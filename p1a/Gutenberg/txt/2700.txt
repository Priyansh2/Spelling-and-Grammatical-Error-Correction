PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.


Of the seventy-three "Epigrams and Jeux d'Esprit," which are printed at
the commencement of this volume, forty-five were included in Murray's
one-volume edition of 1837, eighteen have been collected from various
publications, and ten are printed and published for the first time.

The "Devil's Drive," which appears in Moore's _Letters and Journals_,
and in the sixth volume of the Collected Edition of 1831 as an
"Unfinished Fragment" of ninety-seven lines, is now printed and
published for the first time in its entirety (248 lines), from a MS. in
the possession of the Earl of Ilchester. "A Farewell Petition to J.C.H.
Esq.;" "My Boy Hobbie O;" "[Love and Death];" and "Last Words on
Greece," are reprinted from the first volume of _Murray's Magazine_
(1887).

A few imperfect and worthless poems remain in MS.; but with these and
one or two other unimportant exceptions, the present edition of the
Poetical Works may be regarded as complete.

In compiling a "Bibliography of the successive Editions and Translations
of Lord Byron's Poetical Works," I have endeavoured, in the first
instance, to give a full and particular account of the collected
editions and separate issues of the poems and dramas which were open to
my inspection; and, secondly, to extract from general bibliographies,
catalogues of public and private libraries, and other sources
bibliographical records of editions which I have been unable to examine,
and were known to me only at second-hand. It will be observed that the
_title-pages_ of editions which have passed through my hands are
aligned; the _titles_ of all other editions are italicized.

I cannot pretend that this assortment of bibliographical entries is even
approximately exhaustive; but as "a sample" of a bibliography it will, I
trust, with all its imperfections, be of service to the student of
literature, if not to the amateur or bibliophile. With regard to
nomenclature and other technicalities, my aim has been to put the
necessary information as clearly and as concisely as possible, rather
than to comply with the requirements of this or that formula. But the
path of the bibliographer is beset with difficulties. "Al Sirat's
arch"--"the bridge of breadth narrower than the thread of a famished
spider, and sharper than the edge of a sword" (see _The Giaour_, line
483, _note_ I)--affords an easier and a safer foothold.

To the general reader a bibliography says little or nothing; but, in one
respect, a bibliography of Byron is of popular import. It affords
scientific proof of an almost unexampled fame, of a far-reaching and
still potent influence. Teuton and Latin and Slav have taken Byron to
themselves, and have made him their own. No other English poet except
Shakespeare has been so widely read and so frequently translated. Of
_Manfred_ I reckon one Bohemian translation, two Danish, two Dutch,
three French, nine German, three Hungarian, three Italian, two Polish,
one Romaic, one Roumanian, four Russian, and three Spanish translations,
and, in all probability, there are others which have escaped my net. The
question, the inevitable question, arises--What was, what is, the secret
of Byron's Continental vogue? and why has his fame gone out into all
lands? Why did Goethe enshrine him, in the second part of _Faust_, "as
the representative of the modern era ... undoubtedly to be regarded as
the greatest genius of our century?" (_Conversations of Goethe_, 1874,
p. 265).

It is said, and with truth, that Byron's revolutionary politics
commended him to oppressed nationalities and their sympathizers; that he
was against "the tramplers"--Castlereagh, and the Duke of Wellington,
and the Holy Alliance; that he stood for liberty. Another point in his
favour was his freedom from cant, his indifference to the pieties and
proprieties of the Britannic Muse; that he had the courage of his
opinions. Doubtless in a time of trouble he was welcomed as the champion
of revolt, but deeper reasons must be sought for an almost exclusive
preference for the works of one poet and a comparative indifference to
the works of his rivals and contemporaries. He fulfilled another,
perhaps a greater ideal. An Englishman turns to poetry for the
expression in beautiful words of his happier and better feelings, and he
is not contented unless poetry tends to make him happier or
better--happier because better than he would be otherwise. His favourite
poems are psalms, or at least metrical paraphrases, of life. Men of
other nations are less concerned about their feelings and their souls.
They regard the poet as the creator, the inventor, the maker _par
excellence_, and he who can imagine or make the greatest _eidolon_ is
the greatest poet. _Childe Harold_ and _The Corsair_, _Mazeppa_ and
_Manfred, Cain_ and _Sardanapalus_ were new creations, new types, forms
more real than living man, which appealed to their artistic sense, and
led their imaginations captive. "It is a mark," says Goethe (_Aus meinem
Leben: Dichtung und Wahreit_, 1876, iii. 125), "of true poetry, that, as
a secular gospel, it knows how to free us from the earthly burdens which
press upon us, by inward serenity, by outward charm.... The most lively,
as well as the gravest works have the same end--to moderate both
pleasure and pain through a happy mental representation." It is passion
translated into action, the pageantry of history, the transfiguration
into visible lineaments of living moods and breathing thoughts which are
the notes of this "secular gospel," and for one class of minds work out
a secular redemption.

It was not only the questionable belief that he was on the side of the
people, or his ethical and theological audacities, or his prolonged
Continental exile, which won for Byron a greater name abroad than he has
retained at home; but the character of his poetry. "The English may
think of Byron as they please" (_Conversations of Goethe_, 1874, p.
171), "but this is certain, that they can show no poet who is to be
compared to him. He is different from all the others, and, for the most
part, greater." The English may think of him as they please! and for
them, or some of them, there is "a better oenomel," a _vinum Dæmonum_,
which Byron has not in his gift. The evidence of a world-wide fame will
not endear a poet to a people and a generation who care less for the
matter than the manner of verse, or who _believe_ in poetry as the
symbol or "_credo_" of the imagination or the spirit; but it should
arrest attention and invite inquiry. A bibliography is a dull epilogue
to a poet's works, but it speaks with authority, and it speaks last.
_Finis coronat opus!_

I must be permitted to renew my thanks to Mr. G.F. Barwick,
_Superintendent of the Reading Room_, Mr. Cyril Davenport, and other
officials of the British Museum, of all grades and classes, for their
generous and courteous assistance in the preparation and completion of
the Bibliography. The consultation of many hundreds of volumes of one
author, and the permission to retain a vast number in daily use, have
entailed exceptional labour on a section of the staff. I have every
reason to be grateful.

I am indebted to Mr. A.W. Pollard, of the British Museum, for advice and
direction with regard to bibliographical formulas; to Mr. G.L. Calderon,
late of the staff, for the collection and transcription of the
title-pages of Polish, Russian, and Servian translations; and to Mr. R.
Nisbet Bain for the supervision and correction of the proofs of Slavonic
titles.

To Mr. W.P. Courtney, the author of _Bibliotheca Cornubiensis_, I owe
many valuable hints and suggestions, and the opportunity of consulting
some important works of reference.

I have elsewhere acknowledged the valuable information with regard to
certain rare editions and pamphlets which I have received from Mr. H.
Buxton Forman, C.B.

My especial thanks for laborious researches undertaken on my behalf, and
for information not otherwise attainable, are due to M. J.E. Aynard, of
Lyons; Signor F. Bianco; Professor Max von Förster, of Wurtzburg;
Professor Lajos Gurnesovitz, of Buda Pest; Dr. Holzhausen, of Bonn; Mr.
Leonard Mackall, of Berlin; Miss Peacock; Miss K. Schlesinger; M.
Voynich, of Soho Square; Mr. Theodore Bartholomew, of the University
Library of Cambridge; Mr. T.D. Stewart, of the Croydon Public Library;
and the Librarians of Trinity College, Cambridge, and University
College, St. Andrews.

I have also to thank, for special and generous assistance, Mr. J.P.
Anderson, late of the British Museum, the author of the "Bibliography of
Byron's Works" attached to the Life of Lord Byron by the Hon. Roden Noel
(1890); Miss Grace Reed, of Philadelphia, for bibliographical entries of
early American editions; and Professor Vladimir Hrabar, of the
University of Dorpat, for the collection and transcription of numerous
Russian translations of Byron's Works.

To Messrs. Clowes, the printers of these volumes, and to their reader,
Mr. F.T. Peachey, I am greatly indebted for the transcription of
Slavonic titles included in the Summary of the Bibliography, and for
interesting and useful information during the progress of the work.

In conclusion, I must once more express my acknowment of the industry
and literary ability of my friend Mr. F.E. Taylor, of Chertsey, who has
read the proofs of this and the six preceding volumes.

The Index is the work of Mr. C. Eastlake Smith.

                    EPIGRAM ON AN OLD LADY WHO HAD
              SOME CURIOUS NOTIONS RESPECTING THE SOUL.

    IN Nottingham county there lives at Swan Green,[1]
      As curst an old Lady as ever was seen;
    And when she does die, which I hope will be soon,
      She firmly believes she will go to the Moon!

                                                                     1798.
                   [First published, _Letters and Journals_, 1830, i. 28.]

FOOTNOTES:

[1] "Swan Green" should be "Swine Green." It lay about a quarter of a
mile to the east of St. James's Lane, where Byron lodged in 1799, at the
house of a Mr. Gill. The name appears in a directory of 1799, but by
1815 it had been expunged or changed _euphoniæ gratiâ_. (See _A New Plan
of the Town of Nottingham_, ... 1744.)

Moore took down "these rhymes" from the lips of Byron's nurse, May Gray,
who regarded them as a first essay in the direction of poetry. He
questioned their originality.



                 EPITAPH ON JOHN ADAMS, OF SOUTHWELL,
                 A CARRIER, WHO DIED OF DRUNKENNESS.

    JOHN ADAMS lies here, of the parish of Southwell,
    A _Carrier_ who _carried_ his can to his mouth well;
    He carried so much and he carried so fast,
    He could carry no more--so was carried at last;
    For the liquor he drank being too much for one,
    He could not _carry_ off;--so he's now _carri-on_.

              A VERSION OF OSSIAN'S ADDRESS TO THE SUN.

                       FROM THE POEM "CARTHON."

    O THOU! who rollest in yon azure field,
    Round as the orb of my forefather's shield,
    Whence are thy beams? From what eternal store
    Dost thou, O Sun! thy vast effulgence pour?
    In awful grandeur, when thou movest on high,
    The stars start back and hide them in the sky;
    The pale Moon sickens in thy brightening blaze,
    And in the western wave avoids thy gaze.
    Alone thou shinest forth--for who can rise
    Companion of thy splendour in the skies!
    The mountain oaks are seen to fall away--
    Mountains themselves by length of years decay--
    With ebbs and flows is the rough Ocean tost;
    In heaven the Moon is for a season lost,
    But thou, amidst the fullness of thy joy,
    The same art ever, blazing in the sky!
    When tempests wrap the world from pole to pole,
    When vivid lightnings flash and thunders roll,
    Thou far above their utmost fury borne,
    Look'st forth in beauty, laughing them to scorn.
    But vainly now on me thy beauties blaze--
    Ossian no longer can enraptured gaze!
    Whether at morn, in lucid lustre gay,
    On eastern clouds thy yellow tresses play,
    Or else at eve, in radiant glory drest,
    Thou tremblest at the portals of the west,
    I see no more! But thou mayest fail at length,
    Like Ossian lose thy beauty and thy strength,
    Like him--but for a season--in thy sphere
    To shine with splendour, then to disappear!
    Thy years shall have an end, and thou no more
    Bright through the world enlivening radiance pour,
    But sleep within thy clouds, and fail to rise,
    Heedless when Morning calls thee to the skies!
    Then now exult, O Sun! and gaily shine,
    While Youth and Strength and Beauty all are thine.
    For Age is dark, unlovely, as the light
    Shed by the Moon when clouds deform the night,
    Glimmering uncertain as they hurry past.
    Loud o'er the plain is heard the northern blast,
    Mists shroud the hills, and 'neath the growing gloom,
    The weary traveller shrinks and sighs for home.

FOOTNOTES:

[2] [I am indebted to the courtesy of Mr. Pierre De La Rose for sending
me a copy of the foregoing _Version of Ossian's Address to the Sun_,
which was "Privately printed at the Press of Oliver B. Graves,
Cambridge, Massachusetts, June the Tenth, MDCCCXCVIII.," and was
reprinted in the _Atlantic Monthly_ in December, 1898. A prefatory note
entitled, "From Lord Byron's Notes," is prefixed to the Version: "In
Lord Byron's copy of _The Poems of Ossian_ (printed by Dewick and
Clarke, London, 1806), which, since 1874, has been in the possession of
the Library of Harvard University as part of the Sumner Bequest. The
notes which follow appear in Byron's hand." (For the _Notes_, see the
_Atlantic Monthly_, 1898, vol. lxxxii. pp. 810-814.)

It is strange that Byron should have made two versions (for another
"version" from the Newstead MSS., see _Poetical Works_, 1898, i.
229-231) of the "Address to the Sun," which forms the conclusion of
"Carthon;" but the Harvard version appears to be genuine. It is to be
noted that Byron appended to the earlier version eighteen lines of his
own composition, by way of moral or application.]



                        LINES TO MR. HODGSON.

                 WRITTEN ON BOARD THE LISBON PACKET.

                                  1.

    HUZZA! Hodgson[3], we are going,
      Our embargo's off at last;
    Favourable breezes blowing
      Bend the canvas o'er the mast.
    From aloft the signal's streaming,
      Hark! the farewell gun is fired;
    Women screeching, tars blaspheming,
      Tell us that our time's expired.
        Here's a rascal
        Come to task all,
      Prying from the Custom-house;
        Trunks unpacking
        Cases cracking,
      Not a corner for a mouse
    Scapes unsearched amid the racket,
    Ere we sail on board the Packet.

                                  2.

    Now our boatmen quit their mooring,
      And all hands must ply the oar;
    Baggage from the quay is lowering,
      We're impatient, push from shore.
    "Have a care! that case holds liquor--
      Stop the boat--I'm sick--oh Lord!"
    "Sick, Ma'am, damme, you'll be sicker,
      Ere you've been an hour on board."
        Thus are screaming
        Men and women,
      Gemmen, ladies, servants, Jacks;
        Here entangling,
        All are wrangling,
      Stuck together close as wax.--
    Such the general noise and racket,
    Ere we reach the Lisbon Packet.

                                  3.

    Now we've reached her, lo! the Captain,
      Gallant Kidd,[4] commands the crew;
    Passengers their berths are clapt in,
      Some to grumble, some to spew.
    "Hey day! call you that a cabin?
      Why't is hardly three feet square!
    Not enough to stow Queen Mab in--
      Who the deuce can harbour there?"
        "Who, sir? plenty--
        Nobles twenty
      Did at once my vessel fill."--
        "Did they? Jesus,
        How you squeeze us!
      Would to God they did so still!
    Then I'd 'scape the heat and racket
    Of the good ship, Lisbon Packet."

                                  4.

    Fletcher! Murray! Bob![5] where are you?
      Stretched along the deck like logs--
    Bear a hand, you jolly tar, you!
      Here's a rope's end for the dogs.
    Hobhouse muttering fearful curses,
      As the hatchway down he rolls,
    Now his breakfast, now his verses,
      Vomits forth--and damns our souls.
        "Here's a stanza[6]
        On Braganza--
      Help!"--"A couplet?"--"No, a cup
        Of warm water--"
        "What's the matter?"
      "Zounds! my liver's coming up;
    I shall not survive the racket
    Of this brutal Lisbon Packet."

                                  5.

    Now at length we're off for Turkey,
      Lord knows when we shall come back!
    Breezes foul and tempests murky
      May unship us in a crack.
    But, since Life at most a jest is,
      As philosophers allow,
    Still to laugh by far the best is,
      Then laugh on--as I do now.
        Laugh at all things,
        Great and small things,
      Sick or well, at sea or shore;
        While we're quaffing,
        Let's have laughing--
      Who the devil cares for more?--
    Some good wine! and who would lack it,
    Ev'n on board the Lisbon Packet?

    UNHAPPY Dives! in an evil hour
      'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
      Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
      Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
      In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
      How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
      But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
      Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

                FAREWELL PETITION TO J.C.H., ESQ^RE^.

    O THOU yclep'd by vulgar sons of Men
    Cam Hobhouse![8] but by wags Byzantian Ben!
    Twin sacred titles, which combined appear
    To grace thy volume's front, and gild its rear,
    Since now thou put'st thyself and work to Sea
    And leav'st all Greece to _Fletcher_[9] and to me,
    Oh, hear my single muse our sorrows tell,
    _One_ song for _self_ and Fletcher quite as well--

    First to the _Castle_ of that man of woes
    Dispatch the letter which _I must_ enclose,
    And when his lone Penelope shall say
    _Why, where_, and _wherefore_ doth my William stay?
    Spare not to move her pity, or her pride--
    By all that Hero suffered, or defied;
    The _chicken's toughness_, and the _lack_ of _ale_
    The _stoney mountain_ and the _miry vale_
    The _Garlick_ steams, which _half_ his meals enrich,
    The _impending vermin_, and the threatened _Itch_,
    That _ever breaking_ Bed, beyond repair!
    The hat too _old_, the coat too _cold_ to wear,
    The Hunger, _which repulsed from Sally's door_
    Pursues her grumbling half from shore to shore,
    Be these the themes to greet his faithful Rib
    So may thy pen be smooth, thy tongue be glib!

    This duty done, let me in turn demand
    Some friendly office in my native land,
    Yet let me ponder well, before I ask,
    And set thee swearing at the tedious task.

    First the Miscellany![10]--to Southwell town
    _Per coach_ for Mrs. _Pigot_ frank it down,
    So may'st them prosper in the paths of Sale,[11]
    And Longman smirk and critics cease to rail.

    All hail to Matthews![12] wash his reverend feet,
    And in my name the man of Method greet,--
    Tell him, my Guide, Philosopher, and Friend,
    Who cannot love me, and who will not mend,
    Tell him, that not in vain I shall assay
    To tread and trace our "old Horatian way,"[13]
    And be (with prose supply my dearth of rhymes)
    What better men have been in better times.

    Here let me cease, for why should I prolong
    My notes, and vex a _Singer_ with a _Song_?
    Oh thou with pen perpetual in thy fist!
    Dubbed for thy sins a stark Miscellanist,
    So pleased the printer's orders to perform
    For Messrs. _Longman_, _Hurst_ and _Rees_ and _Orme_.
    Go--Get thee hence to Paternoster Row,
    Thy patrons wave a duodecimo!
    (Best form for _letters_ from a distant land,
    It fits the pocket, nor fatigues the hand.)
    Then go, once more the joyous work commence[14]
    With stores of anecdote, and grains of sense,
    Oh may Mammas relent, and Sires forgive!
    And scribbling Sons grow dutiful and live!

    OH well done Lord E---- n! and better done R----r![22]
      Britannia must prosper with councils like yours;
    Hawkesbury, Harrowby, help you to guide her,
      Whose remedy only must _kill_ ere it cures:
    Those villains; the Weavers, are all grown refractory,
     Asking some succour for Charity's sake--
    So hang them in clusters round each Manufactory,
      That will at once put an end to _mistake_.[23]

    The rascals, perhaps, may betake them to robbing,
      The dogs to be sure have got nothing to eat--
    So if we can hang them for breaking a bobbin,
      'T will save all the Government's money and meat:
    Men are more easily made than machinery--
      Stockings fetch better prices than lives--
    Gibbets on Sherwood will heighten the scenery,
      Shewing how Commerce, how Liberty thrives!

    Some Lords, to be sure, would have summoned the Judges,
      To take their opinion, but that they ne'er shall,
    For LIVERPOOL such a concession begrudges,
      So now they're condemned by _no Judges_ at all.

    Some folks for certain have thought it was shocking,
      When Famine appeals and when Poverty groans,
    That Life should be valued at less than a stocking,
      And breaking of frames lead to breaking of bones.
    If it should prove so, I trust, by this token,
      (And who will refuse to partake in the hope?)
    That the frames of the fools may be first to be _broken_,
      Who, when asked for a _remedy_, sent down a _rope_.

FOOTNOTES:

[30] [One evening, in the late spring or early summer of 1813, Byron and
Moore supped on bread and cheese with Rogers. Their host had just
received from Lord Thurlow [Edward Hovell Thurlow, 1781-1829] a copy of
his _Poems on Several Occasions_ (1813), and Byron lighted upon some
lines to Rogers, "On the Poem of Mr. Rogers, entitled 'An Epistle to a
Friend.'" The first stanza ran thus--

    "When Rogers o'er this labour bent,
    Their purest fire the Muses lent,
    T' illustrate this sweet argument."

"Byron," says Moore, "undertook to read it aloud;--but he found it
impossible to get beyond the first two words. Our laughter had now
increased to such a pitch that nothing could restrain it. Two or three
times he began; but no sooner had the words 'When Rogers' passed his
lips, than our fit burst forth afresh,--till even Mr. Rogers himself ...
found it impossible not to join us. A day or two after, Lord Byron sent
me the following:--'My dear Moore, "When Rogers" must not see the
enclosed, which I send for your perusal.'"--_Life_, p. 181; _Letters_,
1898, ii. 211-213, _note_ 1.]

Thurlow's poems are by no means contemptible. A sonnet, "To a Bird, that
haunted the Water of Lacken, in the Winter," which Charles Lamb
transcribed in one of Coleridge's note-books, should be set over against
the absurd lines, "On the Poems of Mr. Rogers."

    "O melancholy bird, a winter's day
      Thou standest by the margin of the pool;
      And, taught by God, dost thy whole being school
    To Patience, which all evil can allay:
    God has appointed thee the fish thy prey;
      And giv'n thyself a lesson to the fool
      Unthrifty, to submit to moral rule,
    And his unthinking course by thee to weigh.
      There need not schools nor the professor's chair,
    Though these be good, true wisdom to impart;
      He, who has not enough for these to spare
    Of time, or gold, may yet amend his heart,
      And teach his soul by brooks and rivers fair,
    Nature is always wise in every part."

_Gentleman's Magazine_ for April, 1813, vol. 83, p. 357, and were

        "_I lay my branch of laurel down_."

    "_THOU_ lay thy branch of _laurel_ down!"
      Why, what thou'st stole is not enow;
    And, were it lawfully thine own,
      Does Rogers want it most, or thou?
    Keep to thyself thy withered bough,
      Or send it back to Doctor Donne:[33]
    Were justice done to both, I trow,
      He'd have but little, and thou--none.

                                  2.

        "_Then, thus, to form Apollo's crown_."

    A crown! why, twist it how you will,
    Thy chaplet must be foolscap still.
    When next you visit Delphi's town,
      Enquire amongst your fellow-lodgers,
    They'll tell you Phoebus gave his crown,
      Some years before your birth, to Rogers.

                                  3.

        "_Let every other bring his own_."

    When coals to Newcastle are carried,
      And owls sent to Athens, as wonders,
    From his spouse when the Regent's unmarried,
      Or Liverpool weeps o'er his blunders;
    When Tories and Whigs cease to quarrel,
      When Castlereagh's wife has an heir,
    Then Rogers shall ask us for laurel,
      And thou shalt have plenty to spare.

language is in the reign of Queen Elizabeth."]



                      THE DEVIL'S DRIVE.[ii][34]

                                  1.

    THE Devil returned to Hell by two,
      And he stayed at home till five;
    When he dined on some homicides done in _ragoût_,
      And a rebel or so in an _Irish_ stew,
    And sausages made of a self-slain Jew,
    And bethought himself what next to do,
      "And," quoth he, "I'll take a drive.
    I walked in the morning, I'll ride to-night;
    In darkness my children take most delight,
      And I'll see how my favourites thrive.                             10

                                  2.

    "And what shall I ride in?" quoth Lucifer, then--
      "If I followed my taste, indeed,
    I should mount in a waggon of wounded men,
      And smile to see them bleed.
    But these will be furnished again and again,
      And at present my purpose is speed;
    To see my manor as much as I may,
    And watch that no souls shall be poached away.

                                  3.

    "I have a state-coach at Carlton House,
      A chariot in Seymour-place;[35]                                    20
    But they're lent to two friends, who make me amends
      By driving my favourite pace:
    And they handle their reins with such a grace,
    I have something for both at the end of the race.

                                  4.

    "So now for the earth to take my chance,"
      Then up to the earth sprung he;
    And making a jump from Moscow to France,
      He stepped across the sea,
    And rested his hoof on a turnpike road,
    No very great way from a Bishop's abode.[36]                         30

                                  5.

    But first as he flew, I forgot to say,
    That he hovered a moment upon his way,
      To look upon Leipsic plain;
    And so sweet to his eye was its sulphury glare,
    And so soft to his ear was the cry of despair,
      That he perched on a mountain of slain;
    And he gazed with delight from its growing height,
    Nor often on earth had he seen such a sight,
      Nor his work done half as well:
    For the field ran so red with the blood of the dead,                 40
      That it blushed like the waves of Hell!
    Then loudly, and wildly, and long laughed he:
    "Methinks they have little need here of _me_!"

                                  6.

    Long he looked down on the hosts of each clime,
      While the warriors hand to hand were--
    Gaul--Austrian and Muscovite heroes sublime,
    And--(Muse of Fitzgerald arise with a rhyme!)
      A quantity of _Landwehr_![37]
          Gladness was there,
    For the men of all might and the monarchs of earth,                  50
    There met for the wolf and the worm to make mirth,
      And a feast for the fowls of the Air!

                                  7.

    But he turned aside and looked from the ridge
      Of hills along the river,
    And the best thing he saw was a broken bridge,[38]
      Which a Corporal chose to shiver;
    Though an Emperor's taste was displeased with his haste,
      The Devil he thought it clever;
    And he laughed again in a lighter strain,
      O'er the torrent swoln and rainy,                                  60
    When he saw "on a fiery steed" Prince Pon,
    In taking care of Number _One_--
    Get drowned with a great _many_!

                                  8.

    But the softest note that soothed his ear
      Was the sound of a widow sighing;
    And the sweetest sight was the icy tear,
    Which Horror froze in the blue eye clear
      Of a maid by her lover lying--
    As round her fell her long fair hair,
    And she looked to Heaven with that frenzied air                      70
    Which seemed to ask if a God were there!
    And stretched by the wall of a ruined hut,
    With its hollow cheek, and eyes half shut,
      A child of Famine dying:
    And the carnage _begun_, when _resistance_ is done,
      And the fall of the vainly flying!

                                  9.

    Then he gazed on a town by besiegers taken,
      Nor cared he who were winning;
    But he saw an old maid, for years forsaken,
      Get up and leave her spinning;                                     80
    And she looked in her glass, and to one that did pass,
    She said--"pray are the rapes beginning?"[39]

                                 10.

    But the Devil has reached our cliffs so white,
      And what did he there, I pray?
    If his eyes were good, he but saw by night
      What we see every day;
    But he made a tour and kept a journal
    Of all the wondrous sights nocturnal,
    And he sold it in shares to the _Men_ of the _Row_,
    Who bid pretty well--but they _cheated_ him, though!                 90

                                 11.

    The Devil first saw, as he thought, the _Mail_,
      Its coachman and his coat;
    So instead of a pistol he cocked his tail,
      And seized him by the throat;
    "Aha!" quoth he, "what have we here?
    'T is a new barouche, and an ancient peer!"[40]

                                 12.

    So he sat him on his box again,
      And bade him have no fear,
    But be true to his club, and staunch to his rein,
      His brothel and his beer;                                         100
    "Next to seeing a Lord at the Council board,
    I would rather see him here."

                                 13.

    Satan hired a horse and gig
      With promises to pay;
    And he pawned his horns for a spruce new wig,
      To redeem as he came away:
    And he whistled some tune, a waltz or a jig,
      And drove off at the close of day.

                                 14.

    The first place he stopped at--he heard the Psalm
      That rung from a Methodist Chapel:                                110
    "'T is the best sound I've heard," quoth he, "since my palm
      Presented Eve her apple!
    When _Faith_ is all, 't is an excellent sign,
    That the _Works_ and Workmen both are mine."

                                 15.

    He passed Tommy Tyrwhitt,[41] that standing jest,
      To princely wit a Martyr:
    But the last joke of all was by far the best,
      When he sailed away with "the Garter"!
    "And"--quoth Satan--"this Embassy's worthy my sight,
    Should I see nothing else to amuse me to night.                     120
    With no one to bear it, but Thomas à Tyrwhitt,
    This ribband belongs to an 'Order of Merit'!"

                                 16.

    He stopped at an Inn and stepped within
      The Bar and read the "Times;"
    And never such a treat, as--the epistle of one "Vetus,"[42]
      Had he found save in downright crimes:
    "Though I doubt if this drivelling encomiast of War
    Ever saw a field fought, or felt a scar,
    Yet his fame shall go farther than he can guess,
    For I'll keep him a place in my _hottest Press_;                    130
    And his works shall be bound in Morocco _d'Enfer_,
    And lettered behind with his _Nom de Guerre_."

                                 17.

    The Devil gat next to Westminster,
      And he turned to "the room" of the Commons;
    But he heard as he purposed to enter in there,
      That "the Lords" had received a summons;
    And he thought, as "a _quondam_ Aristocrat,"
    He might peep at the Peers, though to _hear_ them were flat;
    And he walked up the House so like one of his own,
    That they say that he stood pretty near the throne.                 140

                                 18.

    He saw the Lord Liverpool seemingly wise,
      The Lord Westmoreland certainly silly,
    And Jockey of Norfolk--a man of some size--
      And Chatham, so like his friend Billy;[43]
    And he saw the tears in Lord Eldon's eyes,
      Because the Catholics would _not_ rise,
      In spite of his prayers and his prophecies;
    And he heard--which set Satan himself a staring--
    A certain Chief Justice say something like _swearing_.[44]
    And the Devil was shocked--and quoth he, "I must go,                150
    For I find we have much better manners below.
    If thus he harangues when he passes my border,
    I shall hint to friend Moloch to call him to order."

                                 19.

    Then the Devil went down to the humbler House,
      Where he readily found his way
    As natural to him as its hole to a Mouse,
      He had been there many a day;
    And many a vote and soul and job he
      Had bid for and carried away from the Lobby:
    But there now was a "call" and accomplished debaters                160
    Appeared in the glory of hats, boots and gaiters--
    _Some_ paid rather more--but _all_ worse dressed
          than Waiters!

                                 20.

    There was Canning for War, and Whitbread for peace,
      And others as suited their fancies;
    But all were agreed that our debts should increase
      Excepting the Demagogue Francis.
    That rogue! how could Westminster chuse him again
      To leaven the virtue of these honest men!
    But the Devil remained till the Break of Day
      Blushed upon Sleep and Lord Castlereagh:[45]                      170
    Then up half the house got, and Satan got up
      With the drowsy to snore--or the hungry to sup:--
    But so torpid the power of some speakers, 't is said,
    That they sent even him to his brimstone bed.

                                 21.

    He had seen George Rose--but George was grown dumb,
       And only lied in thought![46]
    And the Devil has all the pleasure to come
      Of hearing him talk as he ought.
    With the falsest of tongues, the sincerest of men--
      His veracity were but deceit--                                    180
    And Nature must first have unmade him again,
    Ere his breast or his face, or his tongue, or his pen,
    Conceived--uttered--looked--or wrote down letters ten,
    Which Truth would acknowledge complete.

                                 22.

    Satan next took the army list in hand,
      Where he found a new "Field Marshal;"
    And when he saw this high command
      Conferred on his Highness of Cumberland,[47]
    "Oh! were I prone to cavil--or were I not the Devil,
      I should say this was somewhat partial;                           190
    Since the only wounds that this Warrior gat,
    Were from God knows whom--and the Devil knows what!"

                                 23.

    He then popped his head in a royal Ball,
      And saw all the Haram so hoary;
    And who there besides but Corinna de Staël![48]
      Turned Methodist and Tory!
    "Aye--Aye"--quoth he--"'t is the way with them all,
      When Wits grow tired of Glory:
    But thanks to the weakness, that thus could pervert her,
    Since the dearest of prizes to me's a deserter:                     200
    _Mem_--whenever a sudden conversion I want,
    To send to the school of Philosopher Kant;
    And whenever I need a critic who can gloss over
    All faults--to send for Mackintosh to write up the Philosopher."[49]

                                 24.

    The Devil waxed faint at the sight of this Saint,
      And he thought himself of eating;
    And began to cram from a plate of ham
      Wherewith a Page was retreating--
    Having nothing else to do (for "the friends" each so near
      Had sold all their souls long before),                            210
    As he swallowed down the bacon he wished himself a Jew
      For the sake of another crime more:
    For Sinning itself is but half a recreation,
    Unless it ensures most infallible Damnation.

                                 25.

    But he turned him about, for he heard a sound
      Which even his ear found faults in;
    For whirling above--underneath--and around--
      Were his fairest Disciples Waltzing![50]
    And quoth he--"though this be--the _premier pas_ to me,
      Against it I would warn all--                                     220
    Should I introduce these revels among my younger devils,
      They would all turn perfectly carnal:
    And though fond of the flesh--yet I never could bear it
    Should quite in my kingdom get the upper hand of Spirit."

                                 26.

    The Devil (but 't was over) had been vastly glad
      To see the new Drury Lane,
    And yet he might have been rather mad
      To see it rebuilt in vain;
    And had he beheld their "Nourjahad,"[51]
      Would never have gone again:                                      230
    And Satan had taken it much amiss,
    They should fasten such a piece on a friend of his--
    Though he knew that his works were somewhat sad,
    He never had found them _quite_ so bad:
    For this was "the book" which, of yore, Job, sorely smitten,
    Said, "Oh that _mine_ enemy, _mine_ enemy had written"!

                                 27.

    Then he found sixty scribblers in separate cells,[52]
      And marvelled what they were doing,
    For they looked like little fiends in their own little hells,
      Damnation for others brewing--                                    240
    Though their paper seemed to shrink, from the heat of their ink,
      They were only _coolly_ reviewing!
    And as one of them wrote down the pronoun "_We_,"
      "That Plural"--says Satan--"means _him_ and _me_,
    With the Editor added to make up the three
    Of an Athanasian Trinity,
    And render the believers in our 'Articles' sensible,
    How many must combine to form _one_ Incomprehensible"!

[34] ["I have lately written a wild, rambling, unfinished rhapsody,
called 'The Devil's Drive,' the notion of which I took from Porson's
_Devil's Walk_."--_Journal_, December 17, 18, 1813, _Letters_, 1898, ii.
378. "Though with a good deal of vigour and imagination, it is," says
Moore, "for the most part rather clumsily executed, wanting the point
and condensation of those clever verses of Coleridge and Southey, which
Lord Byron, adopting a notion long prevalent, has attributed to Porson."
The _Devil's Walk_ was published in the _Morning Post_, September 6,
1799. It has been published under Porson's name (1830, ed. H. Montague,
illustrated by Cruikshank). (See _Poetical Works_, 1898, i. 30, _note_
1.)]

[35] [Lord Yarmouth, nicknamed "Red Herrings," the eldest son of the
Regent's elderly favourite, the Marchioness of Hertford (the "Marchesa"
of the _Twopenny Post-Bag_), lived at No. 7, Seamore Place, Mayfair.
Compare Moore's "Epigram:" "'I want the Court Guide,' said my lady, 'to
look If the House, Seymour Place, be at 30 or 20,'" etc.--_Poetical
Works_, 1850, p. 165.]

[36] [The allusion may be to a case which was before the courts, the
Attorney-General _v_. William Carver and Brownlow Bishop of Winchester
(see _Morning Chronicle_, November 17, 1813). Carver held certain
premises under the Bishop of Winchester, at the entrance of Portsmouth
Harbour, which obstructed the efflux and reflux of the tide. "The fact,"
said Mr. Serjeant Lens, in opening the case for the Crown, "was of great
magnitude to the entire nation, since it effected the security, and even
the existence of one of the principal harbours of Great Britain."]

[37] [The Russian and Austrian troops at the battle of Leipsic, October
16, 1813, were, for the most part, veterans, while the Prussian
contingent included a large body of militia.]

[38] [For the incident of the "broken bridge" Byron was indebted to the
pages of the _Morning Chronicle_ of November 8, 1813, "Paris Papers,
October 30"--

"The Emperor had ordered the engineers to form fougades under the grand
bridge which is between Leipsic and Lindenau, in order to blow it up at
the latest moment, and thus to retard the march of the enemy and give
time to our baggage to file off. General Dulauloy had entrusted the
operation to Colonel Montford. The Colonel, instead of remaining on the
spot to direct it, and to give the signal, ordered a corporal and four
sappers to blow up the bridge the instant the enemy should appear. The
corporal, an ignorant fellow, and ill comprehending the nature of the
duty with which he was charged, upon hearing the first shot discharged
from the ramparts of the city, set fire to the fougades and blew up the
bridge. A part of the army was still on the other side, with a park of
80 pieces of artillery and some hundreds of waggons. The advance of this
part of the army, who were approaching the bridge, seeing it blow up,
conceived it was in the power of the enemy. A cry of dismay spread from
rank to rank. 'The enemy are close upon our rear, and the bridges are
destroyed!' The unfortunate soldiers dispersed, and endeavoured to
effect their escape as well as they could. The Duke of Tarentum swam
across the river. Prince Poniatowsky, mounted on a spirited horse,
darted into the water and appeared no more. The Emperor was not informed
of this disaster until it was too late to remedy it.... Colonel Montfort
and the corporal of the sappers have been handed over to a
court-martial."]

[39] [Compare _Don Juan_, Canto VIII. stanza cxxxii. line 4. Sir Walter
Scott (_Journal_, October 30, 1826 [1890, i. 288]), tells the same story
of "an old woman who, when Carlisle was taken by the Highlanders in
1745, chose to be particularly apprehensive of personal violence, and
shut herself up in a closet, in order that she might escape ravishment.
But no one came to disturb her solitude, and ... by and by she popped
her head out of her place of refuge with the pretty question, 'Good
folks, can you tell me when the ravishing is going to begin?'" In 1813
Byron did not know Scott, and must have stolen the jest from some older
writer. It is, probably, of untold antiquity.]

[40] [The "Four-Horse" Club, founded in 1808, was incorrectly styled the
Four-in-Hand Club, and the Barouche Club. According to the Club rules,
the barouches were "yellow-bodied, with 'dickies,' the horses bay, with
rosettes at their heads, and the harness silver-mounted. The members
wore a drab coat reaching to the ankles, with three tiers of pockets,
and mother-o'-pearl buttons as large as five-shilling pieces. The
waistcoat was blue, with yellow stripes an inch wide; breeches of plush,
with strings and rosettes to each knee; and it was _de rigueur_ that the
hat should be 3-1/2 inches deep in the crown." (See _Driving_, by the
Duke of Beaufort, K.G., 1894, pp. 251-258.)

The "ancient peer" may possibly be intended for the President of the
Club, Philip Henry, fifth Earl of Chesterfield (1755-1815), who was a
member of the Privy Council, and had been Postmaster-General and Master
of the Horse.]

[41] [Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt (_circ_. 1762-1833) was the son of the Rev.
Edmund Tyrwhitt, Rector of Wickham Bishops, etc., and nephew of Thomas
Tyrwhitt, the editor of the _Canterbury Tales_. He was Private Secretary
to the Prince of Wales, auditor of the Duchy of Cornwall (1796), and
Lord Warden of the Stannaries (1805). He was knighted May 8, 1812. He
was sent in the following year in charge of the Garter mission to the
Czar, and on that occasion was made a Knight of the Imperial Order of
St. Anne, First Class. He held the office of Gentleman Usher of the
Black Rod, 1812-1832. "Tommy Tyrwhitt" was an important personage at
Carlton House, and shared with Colonel McMahon the doubtful privilege of
being a confidential servant of the Prince Regent. Compare Letter III.
of Moore's _Twopenny Post-Bag_, 1813, p. 12. "From G.R. to the E. of
Y----th."

    "I write this in bed while my whiskers are airing,
    And M--c has a sly dose of jalap preparing
    For poor T--mm--y T--rr--t at breakfast to quaff--
    As I feel I want something to give me a laugh,
    And there's nothing so good as old T--mm--y kept close
    To his Cornwall accounts, after taking a dose!"

See _Gentleman's Magazine_, March, 1833, vol. 103, pt. i. pp. 275, 276.]

[42] ["Vetus" [Edward Sterling] contributed a series of letters to the
_Times_, 1812, 1813. They were afterwards republished. Vetus was not a
Little Englander, and his political sentiments recall the _obiter dicta_
of contemporary patriots; _e.g._ "the only legitimate basis for a
treaty, if not on the part of the Continental Allies, at least for
England herself [is] that she should conquer all she can, and keep all
she conquers. This is not by way of retaliation, however just, upon so
obdurate and rapacious an enemy--but as an indispensable condition of
her own safety and existence." The letters were reviewed under the
heading of "Illustrations of Vetus," in the _Morning Chronicle_,
December 2, 10, 16, 18; 1813. The reviewer and Byron did not take the
patriotic view of the situation.]

[43] [Robert Banks Jenkinson (1770-1828), second Earl of Liverpool, on
the assassination of Perceval, became Prime Minister, June 7, 1812; John
Fane (1759-1841), tenth Earl of Westmoreland, was Lord Privy Seal,
1798-1827; Charles Howard (1746-1815), eleventh Duke of Norfolk, known
as "Jockey of Norfolk," was a Protestant and a Liberal, and at one time
a friend of the Prince of Wales. Wraxall, _Posthumous Memoirs_, 1836, i.
29, says that "he might have been mistaken for a grazier or a butcher by
his dress and appearance." He figures _largely_ in Gillray, see _e.g._
"Meeting of the Moneyed Interest," December, 1798. John Pitt
(1756-1835), second Earl of Chatham, the hero of the abortive Walcheren
expedition, had been made a general in the army January 1, 1812. He
"inherited," says Wraxall, _ibid._, iii. 129, "his illustrious father's
form and figure; but not his mind."]

[44] [Edward Law (1750-1818), first Baron Ellenborough, Lord Chief
Justice of the King's Bench, 1802-18, was given to the use of strong
language. His temper (see Moore's "Sale of the Tools") was "none of the
best." On one occasion, speaking in the House of Lords (March 22, 1813)
with regard to the "delicate investigation," he asserted that the
accusation ["that the persons intrusted had thought fit to fabricate an
unauthorized document"] "was as false as hell;" and by way of protest
against the tedious harangues of old Lord Darnley, "I am answerable to
God for my time, and what account can I give at the day of judgment if I
stay here longer?"]

[45] [Compare Moore's "Insurrection of the Papers"--

    "Last night I toss'd and turn'd in bed,
    But could not sleep--at length I said,
    'I'll think of Viscount C--stl--r--gh,
    And of his speeches--that's the way.'"]

[46] [George Rose (1744-1818) was at this time Treasurer of the Navy.
Wraxall, who quotes the "Probationary Odes" with regard to his alleged
duplicity, testifies that he "knew him well in his official capacity,
during at least twelve years, and never found him deficient in honour or
sincerity" (_Posthumous Memoirs_, 1836, i. 148). Moore ("Parody of a
Celebrated Letter") makes the Regent conceive how shocked the king would
be to wake up sane and find "that R--se was grown honest, or
W--stm--rel--nd wiser."]

[47] [Ernest Augustus (1771-1851), Duke of Cumberland and King of
Hanover, fifth son of George III., was gazetted as Field-Marshal
November 27, 1813. His "wounds," which, according to the Duke's sworn
testimony, were seventeen in number, were inflicted during an encounter
with his valet, Joseph Sellis (? Sélis), a Piedmontese, who had
attempted to assassinate the Prince (June 1, 1810), and, shortly
afterwards, was found with his throat cut. A jury of Westminster
tradesmen brought in a verdict of _felo de se_ against Sellis. The event
itself and the trial before the coroner provoked controversy and the
grossest scandal. The question is discussed and the Duke exonerated of
the charges brought against him, by J.H. Jesse, _Memoirs, etc., of
George III._, 1864, iii. 545, 546, and by George Rose, _Diaries, etc._,
1860, ii. 437-446. The scandal was revived in 1832 by the publication of
a work entitled _The Authentic Memoirs of the Court of England for the
last Seventy Years._ The printer and publisher of the work was found
guilty. (See _The Trial of Josiah Phillips for a Libel on the Duke of
Cumberland_, 1833.)]

[48] ["At half-past nine [Wednesday, December 8, 1813] there was a grand
dress party at Carlton House, at which her Majesty and the Prince Regent
most graciously received the following distinguished characters from the
Russian Court, viz. the Count and Countess Leiven, Mad. La Barrone
(_sic_) de Staël, Monsieur de Staël," etc.--_Morning Chronicle_,
December 10, 1813.]

[49] [In the review of Madame de Staël's _De L'Allemagne_ (_Edinburgh
Review_, October, 1813, vol. 22, pp. 198-238), Sir James Mackintosh
enlarged upon and upheld the "opinions of Kant" as creative and seminal
in the world of thought. In the same article he passes in review the
systems of Hobbes, Paley, Bentham, Reid, etc., and finds words of praise
and admiration for each in turn. See, too, a passage (p. 226) in which
he alludes to Coleridge as a living writer, whose "singular character
and unintelligible style" might, in any other country but England, have
won for him attention if not approval. His own "conversion" from the
extreme liberalism of the _Vindiciæ Gallicæ_ of 1791 to the philosophic
conservatism of the _Introductory Discourse_ (1798) to his lecture on
_The Law of Nature and Nations_, was regarded with suspicion by
Wordsworth and Coleridge, who, afterwards, were still more effectually
"converted" themselves.]

Frances Sheridan, _née_ Chamberlaine, 1724-1766), was played for the
first time at Drury Lane Theatre, November 25, 1813. Byron was
exceedingly indignant at being credited with the authorship or
adaptation. (See Letter to Murray, November 27, 1813, _Letters_, 1898,
ii. 288, _note_ 1.) Miss Sophia Lee, who wrote some of the _Canterbury
Tales_, "made a very elegant musical drama of it" (_Memoirs of Mrs. F.

The discovery "that King Charles I. was buried in the vault of King
Henry VIII.," was made on completing the mausoleum which George III.
caused to be built in the tomb-house. The Prince Regent was informed of
the circumstance, and on April 1, 1813, the day after the funeral of his
mother-in-law, the Duchess of Brunswick, he superintended in person the
opening of the leaden coffin, which bore the inscription, "King Charles,
1648" (_sic_). See _An Account of what appeared on Opening the Coffin of
King Charles the First_, by Sir H. Halford, Bart., 1813, pp. 6, 7.

frolic prince, the "Adonis of fifty," who was in a good humour, and "had
given to Princess Charlotte the centre sapphire of Charles's crown,"
acted "the manner of decapitation on my shoulders." He had "forgotten"
Cromwell, who, as Lord Auchinleck reminded Dr. Johnson, had "gart kings
ken that they had a _lith_ in their neck!"]

                         CONDOLATORY ADDRESS

         TO SARAH COUNTESS OF JERSEY, ON THE PRINCE REGENT'S
                RETURNING HER PICTURE TO MRS. MEE.[56]

    WHEN the vain triumph of the imperial lord,
    Whom servile Rome obeyed, and yet abhorred,
    Gave to the vulgar gaze each glorious bust,
    That left a likeness of the brave, or just;
    What most admired each scrutinising eye
    Of all that decked that passing pageantry?
    What spread from face to face that wondering air?
    The thought of Brutus[57]--for his was not there!
    That absence proved his worth,--that absence fixed
    His memory on the longing mind, unmixed;                             10
    And more decreed his glory to endure,
    Than all a gold Colossus could secure.

    If thus, fair Jersey, our desiring gaze
    Search for thy form, in vain and mute amaze,
    Amidst those pictured charms, whose loveliness,
    Bright though they be, thine own had rendered less:
    If he, that VAIN OLD MAN, whom truth admits
    Heir of his father's crown, and of his wits,
    If his corrupted eye, and withered heart,
    Could with thy gentle image bear to part;                            20
    That tasteless shame be _his_, and ours the grief,
    To gaze on Beauty's band without its chief:
    Yet Comfort still one selfish thought imparts,
    We lose the portrait, but preserve our hearts.

    What can his vaulted gallery now disclose?
    A _garden_ with all flowers--except the rose;--
    A _fount_ that only wants its living stream;
    A _night_, with every star, save Dian's beam.
    Lost to our eyes the present forms shall be,
    That turn from tracing them to dream of thee;                        30
    And more on that recalled resemblance pause,
    Than all he _shall_ not force on our applause.

    Long may thy yet meridian lustre shine,
    With all that Virtue asks of Homage thine:
    The symmetry of youth--the grace of mien--
    The eye that gladdens--and the brow serene;
    The glossy darkness of that clustering hair,[58]
    Which shades, yet shows that forehead more than fair!
    Each glance that wins us, and the life that throws
    A spell which will not let our looks repose,                         40
    But turn to gaze again, and find anew
    Some charm that well rewards another view.
    These are not lessened, these are still as bright,
    Albeit too dazzling _for a dotard's sight_;
    And those must wait till ev'ry charm is gone,
    To please the paltry heart that pleases none;--
    That dull cold sensualist, whose sickly eye
    In envious dimness passed thy portrait by;
    Who racked his little spirit to combine
    Its hate of _Freedom's_ loveliness, and _thine_.                     50

               FRAGMENT OF AN EPISTLE TO THOMAS MOORE.

    "WHAT say _I_?"--not a syllable further in prose;
    I'm your man "of all measures," dear Tom,--so here goes!
    Here goes, for a swim on the stream of old Time,
    On those buoyant supporters, the bladders of rhyme.
    If our weight breaks them down, and we sink in the flood,
    We are smothered, at least, in respectable mud,
    Where the divers of Bathos lie drowned in a heap,
    And Southey's last Pæan has pillowed his sleep;
    That _Felo de se_ who, half drunk with his Malmsey,
    Walked out of his depth and was lost in a calm sea,                  10
    Singing "Glory to God" in a spick and span stanza,
    The like (since Tom Sternhold was choked) never man saw.[59]

    The papers have told you, no doubt, of the fusses,
    The fêtes, and the gapings to get at these Russes,[60]--
    Of his Majesty's suite, up from coachman to Hetman,--
    And what dignity decks the flat face of the great man.
    I saw him, last week, at two balls and a party,--
    For a Prince, his demeanour was rather too hearty.
    You know, _we_ are used to quite different graces,

           *       *       *       *       *

    The Czar's look, I own, was much brighter and brisker,               20
    But then he is sadly deficient in whisker;
    And wore but a starless blue coat, and in kersey-
    mere breeches whisked round, in a waltz with the Jersey,[61]
    Who, lovely as ever, seemed just as delighted
    With Majesty's presence as those she invited.

           *       *       *       *       *

From June 6 to June 27, 1814, the Emperor of Russia, and the King of
Prussia were in England. Huge crowds watched all day and night outside
the Pulteney Hotel (105, Piccadilly), where the Emperor of Russia
stayed. Among the foreigners in London were Nesselrode, Metternich,
Blücher, and Platoff, Hetman of the Cossacks. The two latter were the
heroes of the mob. _Ibid_., p. 93, _note_ 1.]

                                  2.

    The sadness which thou seest is not sorrow;
      My wounds are far too deep for simple grief;
    The heart thus withered, seeks in vain to borrow

    When the web that we weave is complete,

      We will fling the winding sheet
      O'er the despot at our feet,
    And dye it deep in the gore he has poured.

[65] [The term "Luddites" dates from 1811, and was applied first to
frame-breakers, and then to the disaffected in general. It was derived
from a half-witted lad named Ned Lud, who entered a house in a fit of
passion, and destroyed a couple of stocking-frames. The song was an
impromptu, enclosed in a letter to Moore of December 24, 1816. "I have
written it principally," he says, "to shock your neighbour [Hodgson?]

      Without remorse, you set up "Ilderim;"[67]
      So mind you don't get into debt,--
    Because--as how--if you should fail,
    These books would be but baddish bail.
    And mind you do _not_ let escape
      These rhymes to _Morning Post_ or Perry,
    Which would be _very_ treacherous--_very_,
    And get me into such a scrape!
      For, firstly, I should have to sally,
      All in my little boat, against a _Galley_;

    Have next to combat with the female Knight:
    And pricked to death expire upon her needle,

             EPISTLE FROM MR. MURRAY TO DR. POLIDORI.[75]

    DEAR Doctor, I have read your play,
    Which is a good one in its way,--
    Purges the eyes, and moves the bowels,
    And drenches handkerchiefs like towels
    With tears, that, in a flux of grief,
    Afford hysterical relief
    To shattered nerves and quickened pulses,
    Which your catastrophe convulses.

      I like your moral and machinery;
    Your plot, too, has such scope for Scenery!                          10
    Your dialogue is apt and smart;
    The play's concoction full of art;
    Your hero raves, your heroine cries,
    All stab, and every body dies.
    In short, your tragedy would be
    The very thing to hear and see:
    And for a piece of publication,
    If I decline on this occasion,
    It is not that I am not sensible
    To merits in themselves ostensible,                                  20
    But--and I grieve to speak it--plays
    Are drugs--mere drugs, Sir--now-a-days.
    I had a heavy loss by _Manuel_--[76]
    Too lucky if it prove not annual,--
    And Sotheby, with his _Orestes_,[77]
    (Which, by the way, the old Bore's best is),
    Has lain so very long on hand,
    That I despair of all demand;
    I've advertised, but see my books,
    Or only watch my Shopman's looks;--                                  30
    Still _Ivan_, _Ina_,[78] and such lumber,
    My back-shop glut, my shelves encumber.

    There's Byron too, who once did better,
    Has sent me, folded in a letter,
    A sort of--it's no more a drama
    Than _Darnley_, _Ivan_, or _Kehama_;
    So altered since last year his pen is,
    I think he's lost his wits at Venice.

           *       *       *       *       *

    In short, Sir, what with one and t' other,
    I dare not venture on another.                                       40
    I write in haste; excuse each blunder;
    The Coaches through the street so thunder!
    My room's so full--we've Gifford here
    Reading MS., with Hookham Frere,
    Pronouncing on the nouns and particles,
    Of some of our forthcoming Articles.

      The _Quarterly_--Ah, Sir, if you
    Had but the Genius to review!--
    A smart Critique upon St. Helena,
    Or if you only would but tell in a                                   50
    Short compass what--but to resume;
    As I was saying, Sir, the Room--
    The Room's so full of wits and bards,
    Crabbes, Campbells, Crokers, Freres, and Wards
    And others, neither bards nor wits:
    My humble tenement admits
    All persons in the dress of Gent.,
    From Mr. Hammond to Dog Dent.[79]

      A party dines with me to-day,
    All clever men, who make their way:                                  60
    Crabbe, Malcolm,[80] Hamilton,[81] and Chantrey,
    Are all partakers of my pantry.
    They're at this moment in discussion
    On poor De Staël's late dissolution.
    Her book,[82] they say, was in advance--
    Pray Heaven, she tell the truth of France!
    'T is said she certainly was married
    To Rocca, and had twice miscarried,
    No--not miscarried, I opine,--
    But brought to bed at forty-nine.                                    70
    Some say she died a Papist; some
    Are of opinion that's a Hum;
    I don't know that--the fellows Schlegel,[83]
    Are very likely to inveigle
    A dying person in compunction
    To try th' extremity of Unction.
    But peace be with her! for a woman
    Her talents surely were uncommon,
    Her Publisher (and Public too)
    The hour of her demise may rue--                                     80
    For never more within his shop he--
    Pray--was not she interred at Coppet?
    Thus run our time and tongues away;--
    But, to return, Sir, to your play:
    Sorry, Sir, but I cannot deal,
    Unless 't were acted by O'Neill.
    My hands are full--my head so busy,
    I'm almost dead--and always dizzy;
    And so, with endless truth and hurry,
    Dear Doctor, I am yours,                                             90

[75] ["By the way," writes Murray, Aug. 5, 1817 (_Memoir, etc._, i.
386), "Polidori has sent me his tragedy! Do me the kindness to send by
return of post a _delicate_ declension of it, which I engage faithfully
to copy."

"I never," said Byron, "was much more disgusted with any human
production than with the eternal nonsense, and _tracasseries_, and
emptiness, and ill-humour, and vanity of this young person; but he has
some talent, and is a man of honour, and has dispositions of amendment.
Therefore use your interest for him, for he is improved and improvable;"
and, in a letter to Murray, Aug. 21, 1817, "You want a 'civil and
delicate declension' for the medical tragedy? Take it."--For J.W.

State for Foreign Affairs. He is associated with the foundation of the
_Anti-Jacobin_ and the _Quarterly Review_. In the drawing-room of

                        EPISTLE TO MR. MURRAY.

                                  1.

    MY dear Mr. Murray,
    You're in a damned hurry
      To set up this ultimate Canto;[84]
    But (if they don't rob us)
    You'll see Mr. Hobhouse
      Will bring it safe in his portmanteau.

                                  2.

    For the Journal you hint of,[85]
    As ready to print off,
      No doubt you do right to commend it;
    But as yet I have writ off
    The devil a bit of
      Our "Beppo:"--when copied, I'll send it.

                                  3.

    In the mean time you've "Galley"[86]
    Whose verses all tally,
      Perhaps you may say he's a Ninny,
    But if you abashed are
    Because of _Alashtar_,
      He'll piddle another _Phrosine_.[87]

                                  4.

    Then you've Sotheby's Tour,--[88]
    No great things, to be sure,--
      You could hardly begin with a less work;
    For the pompous rascallion,
    Who don't speak Italian
      Nor French, must have scribbled by guess-work.

                                  5.

    No doubt he's a rare man
    Without knowing German
      Translating his way up Parnassus,
    And now still absurder
    He meditates Murder
      As you'll see in the trash he calls _Tasso's_.

                                  6.

    But you've others his betters
    The real men of letters
      Your Orators--Critics--and Wits--
    And I'll bet that your Journal
    (Pray is it diurnal?)
      Will pay with your luckiest hits.

                                  7.

    You can make any loss up
    With "Spence"[89] and his gossip,
      A work which must surely succeed;
    Then Queen Mary's Epistle-craft,[90]
    With the new "Fytte" of "Whistlecraft,"
      Must make people purchase and read.

                                  8.

    Then you've General Gordon,[91]
    Who girded his sword on,
      To serve with a Muscovite Master,
    And help him to polish
    A nation so owlish,
      They thought shaving their beards a disaster.

                                  9.

    For the man, "_poor and shrewd_,"[92]
    With whom you'd conclude
      A compact without more delay,
    Perhaps some such pen is
    Still extant in Venice;
      But please, Sir, to mention _your pay_.

                                 10.

    Now tell me some news
    Of your friends and the Muse,
      Of the Bar, or the Gown, or the House,
    From Canning, the tall wit,
    To Wilmot,[93] the small wit,
      Ward's creeping Companion and _Louse_,

                                 11.

    Who's so damnably bit
    With fashion and Wit,
      That he crawls on the surface like Vermin,
    But an Insect in both,--
    By his Intellect's growth,
      Of what size you may quickly determine.[94]

Magazine_ in August, 1818, and remained its joint proprietor till
December, 1819, when it became the property of William Blackwood. But
perhaps the reference is to Byron's Swiss Journal of September, 1816.]

[86] [Henry Gaily Knight (1786-1846), who was a contemporary of Byron at
Trinity College, Cambridge, was a poetaster, and, afterwards, a writer

subject for more than one indifferent _jeu d'esprit_.]

[87] [_Phrosyne_, a Grecian tale, and _Alashtar_, an Arabian tale, were
published in 1817. In a letter to Murray, September 4, 1817, Byron
writes, "I have received safely, though tardily, the magnesia and
tooth-powder, _Phrosine_ and _Alashtar_. I shall clean my teeth with
one, and wipe my shoes with the other."--_Letters_, 1901, iv.]

R.A., was appointed English Consul at Venice, October, 1814. (See
_Letters_, 1900, iv. 83, _note_ I.) The quatrain was translated (see the
following poem) into eleven different languages--Greek, Latin, Italian
(also the Venetian dialect), German, French, Spanish, Illyrian, Hebrew,
Armenian, and Samaritan, and printed "in a small neat volume in the
seminary of Padua." For nine of these translations see _Works_, 1832,
xi. pp. 324-326, and 1891, p. 571. Rizzo was a Venetian surname. See W.

                        AN EPIGRAM BEWITCHED.]

    OF rhymes I printed seven volumes--[96]
    The list concludes John Murray's columns:
    Of these there have been few translations[97]
    For Gallic or Italian nations;
    And one or two perhaps in German--
    But in this last I can't determine.
    But then I only sung of passions
    That do not suit with modern fashions;
    Of Incest and such like diversions
    Permitted only to the Persians,
    Or Greeks to bring upon their stages--
    But that was in the earlier ages
    Besides my style is the romantic,
    Which some call fine, and some call frantic;
    While others are or would seem _as_ sick
    Of repetitions nicknamed Classic.
    For my part all men must allow
    Whatever I was, I'm classic now.
    I saw and left my fault in time,
    And chose a topic all sublime--
    Wondrous as antient war or hero--
    Then played and sung away like Nero,
    Who sang of Rome, and I of Rizzo:
    The subject has improved my wit so,
    The first four lines the poet sees
    Start forth in fourteen languages!
    Though of seven volumes none before
    Could ever reach the fame of four,
    Henceforth I sacrifice all Glory
    To the Rinaldo of my Story:
    I've sung his health and appetite
    (The last word's not translated right--
    He's turned it, God knows how, to vigour)[98]
    I'll sing them in a book that's bigger.
    Oh! Muse prepare for thy Ascension!
    And generous Rizzo! thou my pension.

[102] [The sixth edition of _Childe Harold's Pilgrimage_ (1813) was
"printed by T. Davison, Whitefriars, for John Murray, Bookseller to the
Admiralty, and the Board of Longitude." Medwin (_Conversations_, 1824,
p. 259) attributes to Byron a statement that Murray had to choose
between continuing to be his publisher and printing the "Navy Lists,"
and "that there was no hesitation which way he should decide: the
Admiralty carried the day." In his "Notes" to the _Conversations_

Admiralty" as "unfounded in fact, and no otherwise deserving of notice
than to mark its absurdity."]



         BALLAD. TO THE TUNE OF "SALLEY IN OUR ALLEY."

                                  1.

    OF all the twice ten thousand bards
      That ever penned a canto,
    Whom Pudding or whom Praise rewards
      For lining a portmanteau;
    Of all the poets ever known,
      From Grub-street to Fop's Alley,[103]
    The Muse may boast--the World must own
      There's none like pretty Gally![104]

                                  2.

    He writes as well as any Miss,
      Has published many a poem;
    The shame is yours, the gain is his,
      In case you should not know 'em:
    He has ten thousand pounds a year--
      I do not mean to vally--
    His songs at sixpence would be dear,
      So give them gratis, Gaily!

                                  3.

    And if this statement should seem queer,
      Or set down in a hurry,
    Go, ask (if he will be sincere)
      His bookseller--John Murray.
    Come, say, how many have been sold,
      And don't stand shilly-shally,
    Of bound and lettered, red and gold,
      Well printed works of Gally.

                                  4.

    For Astley's circus Upton[105] writes,
      And also for the Surry; (_sic_)
    Fitzgerald weekly still recites,
      Though grinning Critics worry:
    Miss Holford's Peg, and Sotheby's Saul,
      In fame exactly tally;
    From Stationer's Hall to Grocer's Stall
      They go--and so does Gally.


                                  5.

    He rode upon a Camel's hump[106]
      Through Araby the sandy,
    Which surely must have hurt the rump
      Of this poetic dandy.
    His rhymes are of the costive kind,
      And barren as each valley
    In deserts which he left behind
      Has been the Muse of Gally.

                                  6.

    He has a Seat in Parliament,
      Is fat and passing wealthy;
    And surely he should be content
      With these and being healthy:
    But Great Ambition will misrule
      Men at all risks to sally,--
    Now makes a poet--now a fool,
      And _we_ know _which_--of Gally.

                                  7.

    Some in the playhouse like to row,
      Some with the Watch to battle,
    Exchanging many a midnight blow
      To Music of the Rattle.
    Some folks like rowing on the Thames,
      Some rowing in an Alley,
    But all the Row my fancy claims
      Is _rowing_--of my _Gally_.

                                                    _April_ 11, 1818.[107]

                                  1.

    MRS. WILMOT sate scribbling a play,
      Mr. Sotheby sate sweating behind her;
    But what are all these to the Lay
      Of Gally i.o. the Grinder?
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  2.

    I bought me some books tother day,
      And sent them down stairs to the binder;
    But the Pastry Cook carried away
      My Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  3.

      And called to the Maid to remind her;
    And what should she bring me for paper
      But Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  4.

    Among my researches for EASE
      I went where one's certain to find her:
    The first thing by her throne that one sees
      Is Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  5.

    Away with old Homer the blind--
      I'll show you a poet that's blinder:
    You may see him whene'er you've a mind
      In Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  6.

    Blindfold he runs groping for fame,
      And hardly knows where he will find her:
    She don't seem to take to the name
      Of Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  7.

    Yet the Critics have been very kind,
      And Mamma and his friends have been kinder;
    But the greatest of Glory's behind

          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

Frenchwoman, by Rulhières, I believe."--Letter to Murray, August 12,
1819, _Letters_, 1900, iv. 346.

Claude Carloman de Rulhière (1718-1791), historian, poet, and
epigrammatist, was the author of _Anecdotes sur la revolution de Russie
en l'anneé_ 1762, _Histoire de l'anarchie de Pologne_ (1807), etc. His
epigrams are included in "Poésies Diverses," which are appended to _Les
jeux de Mains_, a poem in three cantos, published in 1808, and were
collected in his _Oeuvres Posthumes_, 1819; but there is no trace of the
original of Byron's translation. Perhaps it is _after_ de Rulhière, who
more than once epigrammatizes "Une Vieille Femme."]

    THERE'S something in a stupid ass,
      And something in a heavy dunce;
    But never since I went to school
      I heard or saw so damned a fool
    As William Wordsworth is for once.

    And now I've seen so great a fool
      As William Wordsworth is for once;
    I really wish that Peter Bell
      And he who wrote it were in hell,
    For writing nonsense for the nonce.

    He gives the perfect work to light!

Wordsworth's _Peter Bell_, inserted in a set of Byron's _Works_
presented by George W. Childs to the Drexel Institute. (From information
kindly supplied by Mr. John H. Bewley, of Buffalo, New York.)

The first edition of _Peter Bell_ appeared early in 1819, and a second
edition followed in May, 1819. In Byron's Dedication of _Marino
Faliero_, "To Baron Goethe," dated October 20, 1820 (_Poetical Works_,
1891, iv. 341), the same allusions to Sir George Beaumont, to
Wordsworth's "place in the Excise," and to his admission that _Peter
Bell_ had been withheld "for one and twenty years," occur in an omitted
paragraph first published, _Letters_, 1891, v. 101. So close a
correspondence of an unpublished fragment with a genuine document leaves
little doubt as to the composition of the "Epilogue."]

      The House into the Lobby O.

    What did the House upon this call,

FOOTNOTES:

[113] [John Cam Hobhouse (1786-1869) (see _Letters_, 1898, i. 163,
_note_ 1) was committed to Newgate in December, 1819, for certain
passages in a pamphlet entitled, _A Trifling Mistake in Thomas Lord
Erskine's recent Preface_, which were voted (December 10) a breach of
privilege. He remained in prison till the dissolution on the king's
death, February 20, 1820, when he stood and was returned for
Westminster. Byron's Liberalism was intermittent, and he felt, or, as
Hobhouse thought, pretended to feel, as a Whig and an aristocrat with
regard to the free lances of the Radical party. The sole charge in this
"filthy ballad," which annoyed Hobhouse, was that he had founded a Whig
Club when he was an undergraduate at Cambridge. He assured Murray (see
his letter, November, 1820, _Letters_, vol. iv. Appendix XI. pp.
498-500) that he was not the founder of the club, and that Byron himself
was a member. "As for his Lordship's vulgar notions about the _mob_" he
adds, "they are very fit for the Poet of the _Morning Post_, and for
nobody else." There is no reason to suppose that Byron was in any way
responsible for the version as sent to the _Morning Post_.]

                 "MY BOY HOBBY O.

                [ANOTHER VERSION.]

        To the Editor of the _Morning Post_.

Sir,--A copy of verses, to the tune of '_My boy Tammy_,' are repeated
in literary circles, and said to be written by a Noble Lord of the
highest poetical fame, upon his quondam friend and annotator. My memory
does not enable me to repeat more than the first two verses quite
accurately, but the humourous spirit of the Song may be gathered from
these:--

                   1.

    Why were you put in Lob's pond,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    For telling folks to pull the House
      By the ears into the Lobby O!

                   2.

    Who are your grand Reformers now,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    There's me and BURDETT,--gentlemen,
      And Blackguards HUNT and COBBY O!

                   3.

    Have you no other friends but these,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    Yes, Southwark's Knight,[*] the County BYNG,
      And in the City, BOBBY O!

[*] "Southwark's Knight" was General Sir Robert Thomas Wilson
(1777-1849), who was returned for Southwark in 1818, and again in 1820;
"County Byng" was George Byng, M.P. for Middlesex; and "Bobby" was Sir
Robert Waithman (1764-1833), who represented the City of London in 1818,
but lost his seat to Sir William Curtis in 1820. All these were advanced
Liberals, and, as such, Parliamentary friends of Hobhouse.

                   4.

    How do you recreate yourselves,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    We spout with tavern Radicals,
      And drink with them hob-nobby O!

                   5.

    What purpose can such folly work,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    It gives our partisans a chance
      Watches to twitch from fob-by O!

                   6.

    Have they no higher game in view,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    Oh yes; to stir the people up,
      And then to head the mob-by O.

                   7.

    But sure they'll at their ruin pause,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    No! they'd see King and Parliament
      Both d--d without a sob-by O!

                   8.

    But, if they fail, they'll be hanged up,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)

                        A VOLUME OF NONSENSE.

      DEAR MURRAY,--
              You ask for a "_Volume of Nonsense_,"
      Have all of your authors exhausted their store?
    I thought you had published a good deal not long since.
      And doubtless the Squadron are ready with more.
    But on looking again, I perceive that the Species
    Of "Nonsense" you want must be purely "_facetious_;"
    And, as that is the case, you had best put to press
      Mr. Sotheby's tragedies now in M.S.,
                Some Syrian Sally
                From common-place Gally,
    Or, if you prefer the bookmaking of women,
    Take a spick and span "Sketch" of your feminine _He-Man_.[115]

    THE Braziers, it seems, are determined to pass
    An Address, and present it themselves all in brass:--

                 [First published, _Letters and Journals_, 1830, ii. 442.]

FOOTNOTES:

[119] [The allusion is explained in Rivington's _Annual Register_,
October 30, 1820 (vol. lxii. pp. 114, 115)--

"ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN.

" ... The most splendid exhibition of the day was that of the
brass-founders and braziers. The procession was headed by a man dressed
in a suit of burnished plate armour of brass, and mounted on a handsome
black horse, the reins being held by pages ... wearing brass helmets....
A man in a complete suite of brass armour ... was followed by two
persons, bearing on a cushion a most magnificent imitation of the
imperial Crown of England. A small number of the deputation of
brass-founders were admitted to the presence of her Majesty, and one of
the persons in armour advanced to the throne, and bending on one knee,
presented the address, which was enclosed in a brass case of excellent
workmanship."--See _Letters_, 1901, v. 219, 220, _note_ 2.

In a postscript to a letter to Murray, dated January 19, 1821, he
writes, "I sent you a line or two on the Braziers' Company last week,
_not_ for publication. The lines were even worthy

    'Of ----dsworth the great metaquizzical poet,
    A man of great merit amongst those who know it,
    Of whose works, as I told Moore last autumn at _Mestri_
    I owe all I know to my passion for _Pastry_.'"

He adds, in a footnote, "_Mestri_ and _Fusina_ are the ferry trajects to
Venice: I believe, however, that it was at Fusina that Moore and I
embarked in 1819, when Thomas came to Venice, like Coleridge's Spring,
'slowly up this way.'"

Again, in a letter to Moore, dated January 22, 1821, he encloses
slightly different versions of both epigrams, and it is worth noting
that the first line of the pendant epigram has been bowdlerized, and
runs thus--

    "Of Wordsworth the grand metaquizzical poet."

FOOTNOTES:

[126] [Napoleon bequeathed to Lady Holland a snuff-box which had been
given to him by the Pope for his clemency in sparing Rome. Lord Carlisle
wrote eight (not seven) stanzas, urging her, as Byron told Medwin, to
decline the gift, "for fear that horror and murder should jump out of
the lid every time it is opened."--_Conversations_, 1824, p. 362. The
first stanza of Lord Carlyle's verses, which _teste_ Medwin, Byron
parodied, runs thus--

    "Lady, reject the gift! 'tis tinged with gore!
    Those crimson spots a dreadful tale relate;
    It has been grasp'd by an infernal Power;
    And by that hand which seal'd young Enghien's fate."

          DO you know Doctor Nott?[127]
          With "a crook in his lot,"
    Who seven years since tried to dish up
          A neat Codi_cil_
          To the Princess's Will,[128]
    Which made Dr. Nott _not_ a bishop.

                                  2.

          So the Doctor being found
          A little unsound
    In his doctrine, at least as a teacher,
          And kicked from one stool
          As a knave or a fool,
    He mounted another as preacher.

                                  3.

          In that Gown (like the Skin
          With no Lion within)
    He still for the Bench would be driving;
          And roareth away,
          A new Vicar of _Bray_,
    Except that _his bray_ lost his living.

                                  4.

          "Gainst Freethinkers," he roars,
          "You should all block your doors
    Or be named in the Devil's indentures:"
          And here I agree,
          For who e'er would be
    A Guest where old Simony enters?

                                  5.

          Let the Priest, who beguiled
          His own Sovereign's child
    To his own dirty views of promotion,
          Wear his Sheep's cloathing still
          Among flocks to his will,
    And dishonour the Cause of devotion.

                                  6.

          The Altar and Throne
          Are in danger alone
    From such as himself, who would render
          The Altar itself
          But a step up to Pelf,
    And pray God to pay his defender.

                                  7.

          But, Doctor, one word
          Which perhaps you have heard
    "He should never throw stones who has windows
          Of Glass to be broken,
          And by this same token
    As a sinner, you can't care what Sin does.

                                  8.

          But perhaps you do well:
          Your own windows, they tell,
    Have long ago sufferéd censure;
          Not a fragment remains

FOOTNOTES:

[127] [George Frederick Nott (1767-1841), critic and divine, was Rector
of Harrietsham and Woodchurch, a Prebendary of Winchester and of
Salisbury. He was Bampton Lecturer in 1802, and, soon afterwards, was
appointed sub-preceptor to the Princess Charlotte of Wales. He was a
connoisseur of architecture and painting, and passed much of his time in
Italy and at Rome. When he was at Pisa he preached in a private room in
the basement story of the house in Pisa where Shelley was living, and
fell under Byron's displeasure for attacking the Satanic school, and
denouncing _Cain_ as a blasphemous production. "The parsons," he told
Moore (letter, February 20, 1820), "preached at it [_Cain_] from Kentish
Town to Pisa." Hence the apostrophe to Dr. Nott. (See _Records of
Shelley, Byron, and the Author_, by E.T. Trelawny, 1887, pp. 302, 303.)]

[128] [According to Lady Anne Hamilton (_Secret History of the Court of
England_, 1832, i. 198-207), the Princess Charlotte incurred the
suspicion and displeasure of her uncles and her grandmother, the Queen,
by displaying an ardent and undue interest in her sub-preceptor. On
being reproved by the Queen for "condescending to favour persons in low
life with confidence or particular respect, persons likely to take
advantage of your simplicity and innocence," and having learnt that
"persons" meant Mr. Nott, she replied by threatening to sign a will in
favour of her sub-preceptor, and by actually making over to him by a
deed her library, jewels, and all other private property. Lady Anne
Hamilton is not an accurate or trustworthy authority, but her extremely
circumstantial narrative was, no doubt, an expansion of the contemporary
scandal to which Byron's lampoon gave currency.]

    LUCIETTA, my deary,

    Is made up of kisses;
    But, in love, oft the case is

    Whose manner and figure
    Now piques me, excites me,
    Torments and delights me--

    UP to battle! Sons of Suli
    Up, and do your duty duly!
    There the wall--and there the Moat is:
    Bouwah![131] Bouwah! Suliotes!
    There is booty--there is Beauty,
    Up my boys and do your duty.

                                  2.

    By the sally and the rally
    Which defied the arms of Ali;
    By your own dear native Highlands,
    By your children in the islands,
    Up and charge, my Stratiotes,
    Bouwah!--Bouwah!--Suliotes!

                                  1.

    I WATCHED thee when the foe was at our side,
      Ready to strike at him--or thee and me.
    Were safety hopeless--rather than divide
      Aught with one loved save love and liberty.

                                  2.

    I watched thee on the breakers, when the rock
      Received our prow and all was storm and fear,
    And bade thee cling to me through every shock;
      This arm would be thy bark, or breast thy bier.

                                  3.

    I watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes,
      Yielding my couch and stretched me on the ground,
    When overworn with watching, ne'er to rise
      From thence if thou an early grave hadst found.

                                  4.

    The earthquake came, and rocked the quivering wall,
      And men and nature reeled as if with wine.
    Whom did I seek around the tottering hall?
      For thee. Whose safety first provide for? Thine.

                                  5.

    And when convulsive throes denied my breath
      The faintest utterance to my fading thought,
    To thee--to thee--e'en in the gasp of death
      My spirit turned, oh! oftener than it ought.

                                  6.

    Thus much and more; and yet thou lov'st me not,
      And never wilt! Love dwells not in our will.
    Nor can I blame thee, though it be my lot
      To strongly, wrongly, vainly love thee still.[132]

    WHAT are to me those honours or renown
      Past or to come, a new-born people's cry?
    Albeit for such I could despise a crown
      Of aught save laurel, or for such could die.
    I am a fool of passion, and a frown
      Of thine to me is as an adder's eye.
    To the poor bird whose pinion fluttering down
      Wafts unto death the breast it bore so high;
    Such is this maddening fascination grown,
      So strong thy magic or so weak am I.

          ON THIS DAY I COMPLETE MY THIRTY-SIXTH YEAR.[133]

                                  1.

    'T IS time this heart should be unmoved,
      Since others it hath ceased to move:
    Yet, though I cannot be beloved,
                Still let me love!

                                  2.

    My days are in the yellow leaf;
      The flowers and fruits of Love are gone;
    The worm, the canker, and the grief
      Are mine alone!


                                  3.

    The fire that on my bosom preys
      Is lone[iii] as some Volcanic isle;
    No torch is kindled at its blaze--
      A funeral pile.

                                  4.

    The hope, the fear, the jealous care,
      The exalted portion of the pain
    And power of love, I cannot share,
      But wear the chain.

                                  5.

    But 't is not _thus_--and 't is not _here_--[iv]
      Such thoughts should shake my soul, nor now
    Where Glory decks the hero's bier,[v]
      Or binds his brow.

                                  6.

    The Sword, the Banner, and the Field,[vi]
      Glory and Greece, around me see!
    The Spartan, borne upon his shield,[134]
      Was not more free.

                                  7.

    Awake! (not Greece--she _is_ awake!)
      Awake, my spirit! Think through _whom_
    Thy life-blood tracks its parent lake,[vii]
      And then strike home!

                                  8.

    Tread those reviving passions down,[viii]
      Unworthy manhood!--unto thee
    Indifferent should the smile or frown
      Of Beauty be.

                                  9.

    If thou regret'st thy youth, _why live_?
      The land of honourable death
    Is here:--up to the Field, and give
      Away thy breath!

                                 10.

    Seek out--less often sought than found--
      A soldier's grave, for thee the best;
    Then look around, and choose thy ground,
      And take thy Rest.

[133] ["This morning Lord Byron came from his bedroom into the apartment
where Colonel Stanhope and some friends were assembled, and said with a
smile--'You were complaining, the other day, that I never write any
poetry now:--this is my birthday, and I have just finished something,
which, I think, is better than what I usually write.' He then produced
these noble and affecting verses, which were afterwards found written in
his journals, with only the following introduction: 'Jan. 22; on this
day I complete my 36^th^ year.'"--_A Narrative of Lord Byron's Last
Journey to Greece_, 1825, p. 125, by Count Gamba. In the _Morning

Verses," and are prefaced by the following note: "We have been indebted

the whole of them, we beg leave to say that the only correct editions
are published by Mr. Murray, of Albemarle Street, and Messrs. J. & H.L.
Hunt, of Tavistock Street. The first eight volumes are to be had from
the former publisher; the last two from the latter. All other editions
are piracies, and inflict even more injury on the sense and poetry of
the noble bard than they do on the property of the proprietors."

note: "This is one of the very few copies preserved of the suppressed
edition, which would have been the Fifth. No Title-page was printed--the
one prefixed was taken from the preceding edition."

_Note_ (2)--Mr. S. Leicester Warren (Lord de Tabley) records the
following MS. notes inscribed in a copy of the Fifth Edition, which had
formerly belonged to James Boswell, jun., and was then in the possession
of Mr. J.R.P. Kirby, of Bloomsbury Street:--

A. A note on the abortive duel between Jeffrey and Moore is dated
November 4, 1811.

B. A note on the fly-leaf in the handwriting of James Boswell, jun.--

"This copy purports on the title-page to be the fourth edition, but is
in truth the fifth. Having pointed out to Murray, the bookseller, a
variation between the copy of the fifth edition and this, he borrowed it
from me, that he might show it to Lord Byron to have the circumstance
explained; that his lordship told him he had printed the fifth edition,
but, before its publication, having repented of the work altogether, he
determined to destroy the whole impression. But the printer, as he
observed, must have retained at least this one copy, and, by putting a
false title-page, had sold it as the fourth edition," etc.--_Notes and
Queries_, 1887, Series V. vol. vii. pp. 203, 204.

Mr. Murray's copy of the Fifth Edition contains, on the fly-leaves at
the beginning of the volume, MS. versions of (1) _The Curse of Minerva_,
pp. [i.]-[xi.]; (2) The Answer to Fitzgerald's Epigram, written at the
"Alfred," on _English Bards, etc._, p. [xv.]; and on p. xvi. the
following MS. Title-page:--

English Bards/ and Scotch Reviewers; a/ Satire/ By Lord Byron./ I had
rather be a kitten, and cry, mew!/ Than one of these same metre
ballad-mongers./ Shakspere./ Such shameless Bards we have; and yet 'tis
true,/ There are as mad, abandon'd critics too./ Pope./ Fifth Edition,/
Unpublished; with considerable additions./ London:/ Printed for James
Cawthorne,/ Cockspur Street./ 1812./

At the end of the volume a MS. version of "Lines on the Removing Lady
Jersey's Portrait from the Gallery of Beauties," is on pp. [85], [86],
and a MS. version of "On a Recent Discovery, 1813," on p. [89].

P. xiv. is headed by the following MS. note: "Lord Byron has two copies
of this work, R.C. Dallas, Esq., has likewise two copies, and Mr. Leigh
Hunt one."

_Note_ (1).--A facsimile of the Title-page (2) faces p. xii. of vol. i.
of the _Poetical Works_, 1898. It has been alleged that large-paper
copies of this edition were issued from the Newark press. It is certain
that large copies (a copy in the British Museum, cut for binding,
measures 220 X 122), printed on paper bearing a water-mark dated 1806,
were thrown upon the market at an early period, but it has not been
ascertained at what date or in what place they were printed. They are
undoubtedly deliberate forgeries. They purport, even in respect of
_errata_, to be identical with the genuine issue of 1807; but they were
not set up from the same type, and it is inconceivable that a second
issue, set up from different type and with slightly different ornaments,
was printed by Ridge for piratical purposes. To cite a few obvious
differences--in the title of the large-paper copies the first A of the
word "TRANSLATED" is printed Λ [Greek: L ], and the Greek ν [Greek: n]
in αινεε [Greek: ainee] and νεικει [Greek: neikei] appears as υ [Greek:
u] (not ν [Greek: n] reversed); in the Errata on the reverse of p.
xiii., [Page] "153 Note" is incorrectly given as "163 Note," and this
slip on the part of the _falsarius_ is more remarkable, as two other
errata in the Errata are carefully reproduced; in the Greek motto on p.
22 the letter ρ [Greek: r] twice appears as ς [Greek: s]; and, finally,
the ornaments on pp. 1 and 187, though intended to be, are not
identical. In the Museum copy a portrait of "Lord Byron, from a sketch
taken on his leaving England," engraved by I. West, and "Published by V.
Hone, Ludgate Hill, 1819," precedes the title-page, and, together with
the binding, affords good, if not conclusive, proof that this copy was
printed before 1820.

See, for a correspondence on these L.P. copies of 1807, the _Athenæum_,
June, 1898, pp. 694, 695.

See, too, for further interesting and conclusive evidence that the
ornament on p. 187 of the L.P. copies was not printed from the Newark
block, _Newark as a Publishing Town_, by T.M. Blagg, 1898, pp. 28-30.

_Note_ (2).--An autograph note, dated May 20th, 1812, signed "Byron," is
inserted on the fly-leaf of a large-paper copy in the Rowfant Library
(_Catalogue_, 1886, p. 144).

_Hints from Horace_.

_Note_.--Two sets of proofs of a portion of _Hints from Horace_,
formerly the property of R.C. Dallas, are preserved in the British
Museum (_Eg_. 2029). Proof A consists of 100 lines of the English
translation (lines 173-272); Proof B, pp. [87]-128, consists of 272
lines of the English translation (lines 1-272) and (on opposite pages)
188 lines of the original Latin. These proof-sheets, which must have
followed proofs of the Fifth Edition of _English Bards_, _etc_., are
preceded by a Half-title, _Hints from Horace_ (Gothic characters), and
by the following subsidiary title:--

Hints from Horace:/ Being a/ Partial Imitation, in English Verse, of the
Epistle,/ "Ad Pisones de Arte Poetica;"/ And intended as a Sequel to/
English Bards and Scotch Reviewers./ [Gothic characters.] "Ergo fungar
vice Cotis, acutum/ Reddere quæ ferrum valet, exsors ipsa secandi."/
Hor. De Arte Poet. 304-5./ "Rhymes are difficult things; they are
stubborn things, sir."/ Fielding's Amelia, Vol. III./ Book and Chap. V./
Athens, Franciscan Convent,/ March 12, 1811./

The publication of _Hints from Horace_ had been entrusted by Dallas to
Cawthorn in July-August, 1811. It may be gathered from various sources
(_Letters_, 1898, ii. 24, 54, 56) that Byron was at work on the proofs
as late as September 4; that by October 11 he had resolved to defer the
publication of the _Hints_; and that, accordingly on October 13, 1811,
"they stood still." It was not, however, till after the appearance of
_Childe Harold's_, _etc_. (May-June, 1812) that Byron determined to
suppress the already printed Fifth Edition of _English Bards_, and at
the same time to abandon the publication of his two other Satires. At
this time, says Dallas (_Recollections of the Life of Lord Byron_, 1898,
p. 241), "the _Hints from Horace_ was far advanced." In his
_Recollections, etc_. (pp. 104-113), he gives, by way of a "fair
specimen," 156 "lines of the still-unpublished poem; and, as these
extracts are taken from the first 211 lines, and his text corresponds
with proof B (see Poetical Works, 1898, i. 390, variants ii., iii.), it
may be inferred that Dallas transcribed them from his fragmentary
proof-sheets, and that the press was stopped at line 272. In 1830, in
his _Notices of the Life of Lord Byron_ (vol. i. pp. 263-269), Moore
printed 165 lines of the "Paraphrase;" but his selections are drawn from
lines 1-458, and it is evident that he had access to an original MS.
(_MS. M._), which is now in Mr. Murray's possession. The full text,
which follows the same MS., was first published in vol. v. pp. 273-327
of the six-volume edition of 1831 (_vide ante_, No. xliii. of "Collected
Editions").


_The Irish Avatar_.

Byron wrote the _Irish Avatar_ at Ravenna, September 16, 1821. On the
17th he sent a copy of the verses to Moore, then resident at Paris; and
on September 20 he desired Moore to get "twenty copies of the whole
carefully and privately printed off." A copy is in the possession of Mr.
H. Buxton Forman, C.B., and I am indebted to his kindness for the
following description: "The pamphlet consists of four 8vo leaves, viz.
half-title ('The Irish Avatar,' in bold capitals, with blank verse), pp.
[1], [2] + Text, pp. 3-8. The poem begins on the third page with a
dropped head, 'The Irish Avatar' again, and the first four verses. Pp.
4-7 contain six verses each, and p. 8 the remaining four, making up
thirty-two in all. The date at the end of p. 8 is 'September 16, 1821.'
There is no title-page proper; a headline, 'The Irish Avatar,' occurs on
pp. 4-8, which pages are numbered in Arabic figures in the outside
corners, and the thirty-two stanzas are also numbered in Arabic figures.
The poem is printed on a half-sheet of a peculiar fine-ribbed paper."
Twenty stanzas of _The Irish Avatar_ were printed by Medwin in
_Conversations of Lord Byron_, 1824, pp. 216-220, and in a second

_Note_.--I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Leonard L. Mackall, of
Berlin, for the substance of the following note on this work:--

"Pages 213-233 of the Anmerkungen" are devoted to an essay on the play
as a whole. This essay is evidently the "Appendix to an English Work,"
to which Byron refers in the letter accompanying the suppressed
Dedication to _Marino Faliero_. "In the Appendix to an English Work,
lately translated into German, and published at Leipzig, a judgment of
yours upon English poetry is quoted as follows: 'That in English poetry
great genius, universal power, a feeling of profundity, with sufficient
tenderness and force are to be found, but that altogether these do not
constitute poets,'" etc., etc. (see _Poetical Works_, 1901, v. 340, 341,
and _Letters_, 1900, v. 100-103). The originals of the Dedication and
Letters were conveyed to Goethe by John Murray the third, in 1830 (?
1831) (see _Goethe-Jahrbuch_, 1899, xx. pp. 31-35, where the
"Dedication" is printed in full for the first time), and are preserved
at Weimar in the "red portfolio" (cf. _Eckermann_, March 26, 1826), in
which Goethe kept all his papers connected with Byron. The "judgments"
quoted by Byron through "an Italian abstract" from Wagner's Appendix
(pp. 217-218) there read _inaccurately_ as follows: "In der Englischen
Poesie," sagt Goethe, "man findet durchaus einen grossen, tüchtigen,
weltgeübten Verstand, ein tiefes, zartes, Gemüth, ein vortreffliches
Wollen, ein leidenschaftliches Wirken ... das alles zuzammengenommen
macht noch keinen Poeten ... nach dieser Ansicht zeigen die meisten
Englischen Gedichte einen düstern Ueberdruss des Lebens." These
sentences, which should be read in the light of the context, will be
found in Goethe's _Dichtung und Wahrheit_, Th. iii. Buch. 13 (1814, now
Wirke, Weimar ed. xxviii. 213, 214), the book (_Aus meinem Leben,
Dichtung und Wahrheit_), which is held up to ridicule in the _Edinburgh
Review_, June, 1816, vol. xxvi. pp. 304-317.

The following note was attached to the "Dedication" which was prefixed
to the First Canto in 1833 (_Works_, 1833, xv. 101):--

"Note(1). [This 'Dedication' was suppressed in 1819, with Lord Byron's
reluctant consent; but, shortly after his death, its existence became
notorious, in consequence of an article in the _Westminster Review_,
generally ascribed to Sir John Hobhouse, and for several years the
verses have been selling in the streets as a broadside. It could
therefore serve no purpose to exclude them on the present occasion.]"
See, too, _Poetical Works_, 1903, vi. 3.

Reynell, Broad Street,/ Golden Square'); Title-page, 'Dedication/ to/
Don Juan./ by/ Lord Byron./ London:/ Published by Effingham
Wilson,/Royal Exchange./ 1833./' On the verso of this is a note--

"'[_Why the following Dedication did not appear with the two first
published Cantos of the Poem cannot be explained--unless the connection
between_ Mr. MURRAY _and_ Mr. SOUTHEY _sufficiently explains it_.]'

"The first page of the Text (p. 5, but not numbered) contains the
dropped head 'Don Juan./ Dedication.' and one stanza. Pp. 6-10 contain
two stanzas each, and p. 11 one. The headline 'Don Juan' runs from p. 6
to p. 11, and the stanzas are numbered in Roman capital figures. P. 12
is blank, and is followed by a Half-title, 'Notes,' with a blank verso.
The Notes occupy pp. 15 and 16, of which 15 is not numbered, but has a
dropped head, 'Notes.' Page 16 is numbered, and has the headline
'Notes.'"

NOTES.


_Note_ (1).--ON GENUINE AND SPURIOUS ISSUES OF "ENGLISH BARDS, AND
SCOTCH REVIEWERS."

Among the first who called attention to the "inextricable tangle" of the
several editions of _English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers_ was Mr.
Leicester Warren, better known as Lord de Tabley, who communicated some
notes in 1877 to _Notes and Queries_ (Series V. vol. vii. pp. 145,
etc.); but it was reserved to the late Mr. Dykes Campbell, Mr. Bertram
Dobell, and other correspondents to the _Athenæum_ (May 5 to July 7,
1894), to point out that the problem was still farther complicated by
the existence of spurious issues of at least three out of the five or
six distinct editions of the Satire.

All editions, genuine or spurious, claim as their publisher "James
Cawthorn, British Library, No. 24 Cockspur Street," but different
printers were employed. The First Edition bears the imprint of "T.
Collins, Printer, No. 1, Harvey's Buildings, Strand;" the Second
Edition, that of "Deans and Co. Hart Street, Covent Garden;" the Third
Edition, that of "T. Collins," etc.; the Fourth Edition of 1810, that of
"T. Collins," etc.; the Fourth Edition of 1811 ("James Cawthorn and
Sharpe and Hailes"), that of "Cox, Son, and Baylis, Great Queen Street,
London." No printer's name was attached to the suppressed Fifth Edition
of 1812.

Genuine First Editions have the water-mark, "E. and P. 1804," or "E. and
P. 1805," or, possibly, no water-mark at all. A copy of the spurious
First Edition, in Mr. Murray's possession, has the water-mark, "S. and
C. Wise, 1812." In addition to at least eleven variants in punctuation,
the spurious copy prints (p. 5, line 47) "Wizzard" (p. 20 _n_.),
"M_e_deira," and, in the same note, "Anna d'Afert;" whereas the genuine
copies print correctly "Wizard," "Madeira," and "Anna d'Arfet."

A genuine copy of the Second Edition, which belonged to the late Mr.
Dykes Campbell, bears the water-mark "Budgen and Willmot, 1808." On p.
80, line 1007, "Abedeen" is misprinted for "Aberdeen;" and the same
misprint occurs in a copy of the Second Edition in the British Museum.
In all probability there was no spurious issue of the Second Edition.

Of the Third Edition (1810), copies bearing the water-mark, "E.&P.
1804," or "G.&R.T.," may be regarded as genuine--rare exceptions among a
host of forgeries which either lack a water-mark altogether or bear
water-marks of a later period. Mr. Gilbert R. Redgrave, in an article
(_The Library_, December 1, 1899, Series II. vol. i. pp. 18-25), notes
two distinct and divergent forgeries bearing the water-mark "Pine, and
Thomas, 1812." Forgery A prints "myse" for "muse" (line 4), "rove" for
"rave" (line 384), etc.; while forgery B, in a footnote to p. 30, prints
"Bowle'ss" for "Bowles's," and, at the end of p. 85, "we" for "me," and
"farther" for "further." Other copies bear the water-marks, "Allnutt,
1816," "Smith & Allnutt, 1816," "Ivy Mills, 1817," and "I.&R. Ansell,
1818." A copy of a spurious issue of the Third Edition in the British
Museum prints "crawl" for "scrawl" (line 47), and "p. 73" for "p. 85."

It has been surmised, but conclusive proof is not forthcoming, that a
so-called Fourth Edition of 1810 (1050 lines), which purports to have
been published by James Cawthorn, and bears the imprint, "_Printed by J.
Collins, Harvey's Buildings, Strand, London_," is a spurious issue. It
is practically a reprint of the Third Edition; but in some copies there
are misprints not to be found in other piracies--_e.g._ "crouds" for
"crowds" (line 269), and "alter" for "altar"(line 285).

Copies of the Fourth Edition of 1810, which may possibly be genuine,
bear a water-mark, "G.&R.T.," or are on plain paper. Copies which are
manifestly forgeries bear the water-marks, "J.X. 1810" and "W.
Pickering, 1816."

A second Fourth Edition (1052 lines), published by "James Cawthorn and
Sharp & Hailes, 1811," and printed by "Cox, Son, & Baylis," was
certainly recognized by Byron as a genuine Fourth Edition, and must have
passed through his hands, or been subject to his emendation, before it
was sent to press. Copies of this edition bear his MS. emendations of
1811-1812, and marginal notes of 1816. Genuine copies (_e.g._ Leigh
Hunt's copy, now in the Forster Collection at the South Kensington
Museum) are printed on paper bearing a water-mark, "J. Whatman, 1805."
There was, however, another issue of the Fourth Edition of 1811, printed
on plain paper. Mr. Redgrave notes certain minute differences between
these two issues. In the edition on plain paper there is a hyphen to
"Cockspur-Street" on the title-page, and the word "Street" is followed
by a comma instead of a semicolon. Again, in the plain-paper copies
"Lambe" is spelt with an _e_, and in the water-mark copies the word is
correctly spelt "Lamb." In the plain-paper copies the misprint
"Postcript" for "Postscript" is repeated, and in the copies bearing a
water-mark the word is correctly spelt "Postscript." There are other
differences in the advertisements at the end of the volume.

A spurious Fourth Edition in Mr. Murray's possession, which has been
enriched with a series of prints of persons and places, bears the
water-marks, "1811," "1814." Each page has been inserted into a folio
sheet bearing the water-mark, "J. Whatman, 1816." A full-sized octavo,
in small print (B.M. 11645 P. 15), which purports to be the Fourth
Edition of 1811, is probably spurious. It is the survival of a distinct
issue from other genuine or spurious copies of the Fourth Edition.

The spurious issues of the Third and Fourth Editions, whether they were
printed in Ireland or were secretly thrown upon the market by James
Cawthorn after Byron had definitely selected Murray as his publisher,
were designed for the general reader and not for the collector. The
issue of a spurious First Edition after the improved and enlarged
editions of 1809-11 were published, must have been designed for the
Byron enthusiast, if not the collector of First Editions.

The Grangerized Fourth Editions prepared by Mr. W.M. Tartt and Mr. Evans
in 1819, 1820, and a Third, by John Murray at about the same period,
and, more remarkable still, a copy of the Fourth Edition of 1811,
prefaced by a specially printed "List of Names mentioned in the _English
Bards, and Scotch Reviewers_" interleaved with the additions made in the
Fifth Edition (B.M.), point to the existence of a circle of worshippers
who were prepared to treat Byron's _Juvenilia_ as seriously as the
minute critics of the present generation. They seem to have been
sufficiently numerous to make piracy, if not forgery, profitable.

_Note_ (3).--THE ANNOTATED COPIES OF THE FOURTH EDITION OF 1811.

Two annotated copies of the genuine Fourth Edition of _English Bards,
etc._ [1811], with MS. corrections in Byron's handwriting, are
extant--one in Mr. Murray's possession, and a second in the Forster
Library at the South Kensington Museum. The former, which contains the
marginal comments marked "B. 1816," has been assumed to have been
prepared as a press copy for the Fifth Edition; but, as the following
collation reveals, the latter, which belonged to Leigh Hunt, represents
a fuller and later, though not a final revision. The half-title bears
the inscription, "Byron, Dec. 31^st^, 1811. N--d. A^y [_i.e._ Newstead
Abbey] B.

    "_Dum relego--scripsisse pudet--quia plurima cerno--
    Me quoque--qui feci--judice digna lini_--B. J^y 20, 1812."

and the verso the words, "Given me by the author on my birthday, Oct.
19, 1815. Leigh Hunt."

P. 5. ingen(-i-)ous. [The misprint is a note of a genuine copy.]

Lines 173, 174.

    (-Low may they sink to merited contempt-)
    (-And scorn remunerate the mean attempt.-)

    Still for stern Mammon may they toil in vain,
    And sadly gaze on Gold they cannot gain.

[This emendation is not given in the Murray copy.]

Lines 257, 258.

    So
  (-How-) well the subject suits his noble mind!
  (-"A fellow feeling makes us wond'rous kind,"-)
  He brays the Laureat of the long-eared kind!

[The Murray copy, which amends line 258 as above, leaves the "How"
unerased, but the Fifth Edition prints "So."]

Lines 323-328.

  And shows, (-dissolved in thine own tears-).
             still whimpering through threescore years.
  (-Whether in sighing-winds thou seek'st relief,-)
  (-Or consolation in a yellow leaf.-)
  Whether in equal strains thou vent'st thy grief
  O'er falling Empires or a yellow leaf.

[The Murray copy gives no emendation. The Fifth Edition adopts the first
correction, but, for the variant in lines 327, 328, reads--

  Whether thou sing'st with equal ease and grief
  The fall of Empires or a yellow leaf.]

Line 336.      All love thy (-strain-)

                               Hippocrene

[The Murray copy adds a note: "The Fifth Edition reads Hippocrene."]

Lines 387, 388.

  (-Too much in turtle Bristol's sons delight,-)
  (-Too much o'er bowls of Rack prolong the night.-)
  Your turtle-feeder's verse must needs be flat,
  Though Bristol bloat him with the verdant fat.

[The Murray copy does not contain this emendation, which was adopted in
the Fifth Edition.

P. 36 _n._ The Hunt copy gives in MS. the note concerning Moore--"I am
informed," etc.--which is printed in the Fifth Edition. There is no
similar annotation in the Murray copy.

Line 502. For (-"ranks illustrious"-) both annotated copies read
"oat-fed phalanx."]

Lines 532, 533.

  And grateful (-to the founder of the feast,-)
  Declare his landlord (-can translate, at least.-)
  And grateful for the dainties on his plate,
  Declare his landlord can at least translate.

  Tires the sad Gallery--lulls the (-listening-) pit.

[The emendation is given in both annotated copies; but the substitution
of "listless" for "listening," which is adopted in the Fifth Edition,
does not appear in the Murray copy,]

Line 563.       Let Comedy (-re-)sume
                             ass

[The correction is not given in the Murray copy.]

Line 569.       and (-Kemble-) lives to tread.
                      Siddons

[The substitution of "Siddons" for "Kemble," which dates from the Fifth
Edition, is not given in the Murray copy.]

Line 728.

  Want is your plea, let Pity be your screen.

  The Spoiler swept that soaring Lyre away,
  Which she had sounded an immortal lay.

L. 903.        Let Moore (-be lewd-)
                         still sigh

[This emendation does not appear in the Murray copy, but the words ["be
lewd"] have been underscored with a pencil, and a X placed against
them.]

Line 946.

  (-And even spurns the great Scatonian prize.-)
  Even from the tempting ore of Seaton's prize.

[This emendation is given in both the annotated copies.]

Lines 965, 966.

  So sunk in dullness (-and so lost in shame-)
  (-That SMYTHE and HODGSON scarce redeem thy fame.-)
  So sunk in dullness that nor Hodgson's verse
  Can make thee better--nor poor Hewson's worse.

[This emendation is not in the Murray copy. The Fifth Edition adopts the
further correction, "So lost to Phoebus" for "So sunk in dullness."]

Line 969.       (-"is-) wove,
                  she wove.

                ----glory in their sires.

[This emendation is not given in the Murray copy.

The Leigh Hunt copy gives twenty MS. emendations (besides "Death" for
"death," in line 820, and the alteration of "rapid" to "rabid" in the
note on Hewson Clarke, line 962) including the note on Moore. The Murray
copy gives nine MS. emendations, of which six are identical with those
in the Hunt copy. Three emendations are peculiar to the Murray copy--]
