the
life
expectancy
of
individuals
has
increased
due
to
better
accessibility
to
healthcare
services
and
facilities
than
before
.

in
addition
,
a
better
health
care
system
will
allow
the
people
to
stay
healthier
and
prevent
some
major
illness
from
happening
like
stroke
and
heart
attack
.

one
cause
for
this
is
attributed
to
the
era
of
baby
boomers
,
who
are
now
mostly
in
their
late
fifties
or
early
sixties
.

before
this
solution
was
implemented
,
they
did
a
further
study
,
and
realized
that
the
solution
will
not
work
;
as
the
farmers
are
using
traditional
farming
methods
which
are
not
yield
efficient
.

due
to
these
problems
,
a
team
of
researchers
have
created
a
system
that
makes
use
of
sensors
to
identify
human
actions
and
uses
mobile
devices
to
remind
the
elderly
to
perform
daily
activities
.

if
the
fertility
rate
continues
to
drop
,
there
will
be
not
-
enough
young
people
to
replace
the
older
generation
.

some
people
argue
that
welfare
of
the
aged
is
a
full
responsibility
of
the
government
as
they
have
contributed
to
the
society
for
many
years
and
it
is
a
way
of
showing
appreciation
to
them
.

with
the
mission
'better
jobs
for
life
'
,
this
institute
is
to
provide
help
to
the
workforce
.

as
the
development
of
technology
,
the
abilities
of
innovation
have
becoming
more
and
more
important
all
over
the
world
.

the
rewarding
of
the
elderly
does
not
push
the
country
forward
,
whereas
it
is
the
upbringing
of
our
youth
that
will
ensure
a
future
for
our
country
.

hence
,
the
individual
should
bear
in
mind
the
impacts
that
may
arise
and
decide
if
they
should
reveal
such
results
.

thus
in
the
next
few
paragraphs
,
i
will
explain
in
depth
on
the
various
research
and
government
policies
being
developed
has
help
to
ease
the
aging
process
.

we
are
not
only
concerning
the
shortage
of
technology
but
also
considering
the
danger
of
terrorists
.

besides
that
,
the
burden
to
take
care
of
the
graying
generation
will
also
be
shared
by
the
children
of
the
elderly
people
-
who
will
be
highly
educated
-
to
find
jobs
easily
to
support
their
families
.

therefore
,
they
may
get
even
more
money
for
their
own
-
than
receiving
-
from
the
government
's
welfare
.

the
parties
involved
take
pride
in
their
work
.

the
safety
of
-
scwr
has
been
proven
and
can
be
better
in
the
future
.

thus
,
compulsory
saving
can
help
guarantee
a
sizable
amount
of
saving
for
their
future
and
is
a
practical
and
effective
way
to
ensure
old
age
dependency
is
-
kept
to
the
minimum
.

in
another
word
,
if
one
was
tagged
,
he
risked
being
permanently
marked
for
life
due
to
the
difficulty
of
removing
the
chip
.

yes
,
they
are
right
,
but
they
are
just
comparing
swcr
with
the
generation
iii
reactors
,
not
-
gfr
reactor
.

for
instance
,
if
our
health
insurance
belongs
to
an
individual
for
earning
purpose
we
should
pay
a
lot
more
to
see
a
doctor
and
get
a
prescription
and
this
makes
the
old
feel
difficult
as
they
can
not
earn
more
after
retirement
but
have
to
visit
hospital
more
frequently
than
before
as
peterson
(
2001
)
said
.

fund
is
an
important
factor
that
determines
whether
the
design
process
can
be
carry
on
or
otherwise
.

in
recent
years
,
modifications
in
architectures
have
been
made
to
ensure
elders
'
safety
.

it
is
the
fact
that
sound
travels
through
matter
as
vibrations
.

therefore
,
we
can
say
that
limitation
on
spending
for
the
aged
is
a
good
idea
since
in
indonesia
,
there
is
still
many
areas
that
are
not
well
developed
yet
-
especially
in
-
economic
area
.

if
a
technology
can
not
apply
well
enough
,
it
can
not
develop
.

some
of
them
are
encouraging
later
retirement
,
raising
more
productive
children
,
encouraging
the
elderly
and
their
families
to
take
more
responsibility
for
their
health
,
etc
.

it
reduces
the
probability
of
making
mistakes
and
level
of
seriousness
of
accidents
.

on
the
contrary
,
people
often
question
the
effectiveness
of
these
initiatives
.

experiments
and
tests
are
not
to
be
omitted
in
laboratories
.

besides
this
,
remote
controlled
lighting
helps
-
elderly
to
control
the
house
lights
with
a
remote
control
,
therefore
,
it
minimizes
the
risk
-
falling
in
the
dark
.

instead
of
treating
the
elderly
in
society
as
an
expense
,
the
government
can
think
of
ways
to
harness
the
knowledge
and
experience
from
them
so
that
they
can
contribute
back
more
into
society
.

therefore
,
the
elderly
have
to
rely
on
the
government
.

thirdly
,
engineering
consists
of
electrical
,
chemical
,
computer
,
radiology
,
nuclear
and
mechanical
-
.

with
rising
oil
prices
and
growing
concerns
of
global
warming
,
countries
are
looking
to
nuclear
power
to
solve
the
energy
needs
of
tomorrow
.

bfa

implemented
on
existing

aging
impacts
a
person
's
well
being
in
many
ways
,
with
both
psychological
and
physical
changes
,
including
chronic
diseases
associated
with
aging
.

besides
,
the
molten
salt
reactor
can
solve
these
problems
perfectly
.

studies
show
that
of
all
people
over
80
,
20
%
suffers
from
alzheimer
-
(
as
cited
in
health-cares.net
,
2005
)
.

in
addition
,
this
testing
also
can
be
used
to
determine
a
child
's
biological
father
or
a
person
's
ancestry
.

whilst
some
insisted
that
the
disclosure
of
the
results
is
necessary
because
it
leads
to
early
detection
of
a
disease
and
thus
enhances
preventability
and
treatability
.

this
is
influenced
by
the
different
social
and
economic
atmospheres
prevalent
.

so
it
has
been
a
controversial
issue
that
whether
government
shall
cut
public
spending
on
the
aged
and
divert
-
to
other
areas
of
economic
development
to
secure
stable
productivity
and
gdp
.

currently
in
the
market
,
they
is

as

which
claims
to
have
remarkable

,
which
can

more
clearly
,
thus
enjoy
their
life
again
is
out
in
display
in
all
corners
of
the
shopping
and
healthcare
centre
.

also
,
it
is
necessary
and
feasible
.

however
,
i
have
to
say
that
these
people
are
so
short-sighted
that
they
did
not
find
the
fundamental
solutions
.

apart
from
that
,
the
aged
is
also
burdened
by
the
inadequate
funds
in
their
cpf
accounts
with
several
reasons
for
the
inadequacy
.

these
are
very
complex
researches
that
could
take
a
long
period
of
time
and
requires
collaboration
with
partners
across
the
world
(
carre
,
2006
)
.

they
develop
certain
technology
which
satisfies
certain
consumer
domains
;
in
comparison
,
scientists
usually
do
not
know
the
use
and
the
specific
consumer
domains
when
they
first
accidently
discover
a
technology
.

the
second
consequence
is
about
the
genetic
discrimination
,
especially
in
employment
and
insurance
(
norrgard
,
2008
)
.insurance
may
not
be
provided
to
an
individual
with
results
showing
the
possibility
of
getting
ill
.

the
original
goal
of
developing
nuclear
technology
is
to
invent
weapons
.

it
is
still
remember
that
in
1979
at
three
mile
island
,
the
reactor
exploded
and
killed
31
at
once
and
spewed
radioactive
across
europe
.

it
is
hard
to
have
a
new
idea
pops
out
from
their
minds
as
they
will
not
think
out
of
the
box
.

the
military
aspect
has
contributed
a
lot
to
technology
improvements
.

nevertheless
,
some
may
argue
that
it
is
to
one
's
``
entitlement
''
to
receive
pension
-
and
other
forms
of
material
benefits
upon
retirement
citation
fer94
\l

(
fernandez
,
1994
)
.

the
government
have
also
been
legislating
laws
that
require
employers
to
offer
re-employment
to
their
workers
until
the
age
of
65.this
is
a
flexible
approach
because
the
workers
do
not
have
to
get
the
same
job
or
pay
.

once
knowing
the
reasons
,
researchers
can
come
up
with
ideas
of
how
to
slow
down
or
even
reverse
the
aging
.

without
the
proper
understanding
,
people
mostly
-
object
-
engineering
design
,
let
alone
the
support
.

indeed
,
for
the
case
of
penicillin
,
fleming
did
not
anticipate
the
discovery
of
penicillin
,
a
type
of
antibiotics
,
when
he
was
making
researches
on
the
characteristics
of
bacteria
.

secondly
,
critics
argue
that
the
vhtr
is
too
costly
and
it
will
ultimately
be
eliminated
in
the
future
due
to
economic
factors
-
just
as
what
happened
to
the
htgr
or
high-temperature-gas-reactor
in
1989
(
international
atomic
energy
agency
,
n.d
)
.

this
is
due
to
the
nature
of
molten
fluoride
salts
,
which
is
used
as
coolant
and
is
mechanically
and
chemically
stable
at
sea-level
pressures
(
forsberg
2004
)
.

after
all
,
not
only
the
young
but
the
old
people
will
also
benefit
from
the
investment
on
education
.

however
,
singaporeans
still
enjoy
heavy
subsidies
in
public
hospital
,
especially
in
the
lower
class
wards
.

one
of
the
policies
is
the
housing
policy
,
which
strongly
encourages
extended
family
by
providing
incentives
and
also
to
provide
the
'elder-
friendly
housing
'
for
the
senior
citizens
.

so
,
the
grown
children
should
continue
with
such
tradition
.

one
of
the
core
theories
-
is
to
teach
people
to
obey
the
rules
and
regulations
.

research
are
also
done
on
other
elderly
illnesses
to
find
out
the
most
efficient
medications
.

this
will
increase
the
willingness
of
the
grown
children
to
take
care
of
their
parents
and
realize
their
obligation
to
their
parents
.

we
need
the
right
tools
for
the
right
kind
of
job
,
we
ca
n't
possibly
use
a
screwdriver
to
do
a
hammer
's
work
,
and
right
now
this
problem
is
being
faced
.

korea
needs
to
reform
its
national
policies
if
it
hopes
to
create
a
better
and
sustainable
future
society
as
there
will
be
a
lot
of
negative
impacts
to
the
country
-
such
as
-
inevitable
labor
shortage
,
increase
in
public
spending
and
healthcare
problems
if
the
ageing
population
continues
to
grow
disproportionately
with
the
country
's
fertility
rate
.

early
mobile
phones
were
heavy
,
bulky
and
expensive
with
very
-
low
coverage
.

many
of
the
researches
of
engineering
design
which
were
carried
out
in
the
modern
countries
had
been
done
successfully
.

(
gen
iv
reactors
,
2009
)
furthermore
,
msr
's
fuel
doubles
up
as
its
coolant
due
to
the
good
heat
transportation
properties
of
molten
salts
further
reduce
on
the
waste
produced
.

the
emission
of
harmful
pollutants
into
the
air
atmosphere
by
motorcars
and
factories
has
affected
human
health
and
this
need
to
be
rectified
.

this
may
result
in
greater
productivity
among
the
workers
as
they
tend
to
be
more
committed
for
their
work
(
valarie
tan
,
2009
)
.

this
also
indicates
a
loss
in
mutual
trust
within
individuals
.

these
robots
can
also
play
a
role
in
taking
care
of
the
elderly
in
the
future
for
instance
-
the
wheelchairs
that
operates
using
buttons
can
replace
humans
pushing
the
wheelchair
.

although
governments
raise
fund
and
increase
budget
to
support
the
elderly
,
healthcare
costs
is
still
high
and
some
of
the
treatments
which
apply
new
technologies
and
methods
are
so
expensive
that
money
they
save
will
run
out
after
a
few
days
.

firstly
,
the
mobility
for
the
elderly
has
been
improved
.

for
example
,
a
factory
in
southeast
china
produces
toys
for
a
japanese
company
and
these
toys
are
sold
to
north
america
.

with
every
year
passes
by
,
they
are
facing
the
limitations
of
their
physical
and
mental
strength
.

despite
this
,
the
crux
of
the
issue
here
lies
in
how
much
should
this
spending
on
the
aged
be
capped
at
.

this
is
because
different
people
will
react
differently
after
knowing
-
individuals
genetic
testing
results
.

as
a
result
,
the
lack
of
fund
will
hamper
the
progress
of
the
design
process
as
there
is
no
material
to
manufacture
a
physical
product
to
test
its
usefulness
.

throughout
the
years
,
there
has
always
been
a
debate
on
whether
technology
shapes
society
,
a
technologically
determinist
perspective
,
or
does
society
shape
technology
,
a
socially
determinist
view
.

spouses
too
have
the
rights
to
know
when
it
comes
to
making
a
family
just
as
he
or
she
has
equal
rights
over
the
children
.

other
than
that
,
engineers
will
also
need
to
go
through
the
process
of
``
analysing
-
and
selecting
a
solution
''
to
make
sure
that
the
new
product
is
fairly
accurate
and
it
will
not
cause
any
health
problem
to
the
user
before
releasing
it
to
the
market
.

it
has
changed
many
aspects
of
our
lives
and
has
unknowingly
-
penetrated
ubiquitously
into
our
society
making
many
of
us
dependent
on
it
.

in
summary
,
vhtr
will
solve
the
nuclear
waste
problems
if
it
is
implemented
as
-
a
generation
iv
reactor
.

this
reduction
will
no
doubt
cripple
on
the
country
's
economy
,
as
funds
will
have
to
be
used
to
cater
to
the
needs
of
the
older
majority
.

in
a
few
years
-
time
,
china
's
aviation
industry
grew
from
small
to
rather
large
and
became
able
to
produce
aircrafts
of
many
kinds
.

this
included
the
consistent
functional
review
of
instruments
and
constant
search
question
identifications
(
bernhard
2007
)
.

being
a
highly
classified
project
,
the
lockheed
's
advanced
development
projects
division
,
a
american
aerospace
company
-
was
funded
by
the
government
to
develop
the
latest
aircraft
to
fight
in
world
war
two
(
roger
,
2003
)
.

firstly
,
a
couple
who
is
planning
get
marry
and
one
of
them
or
a
close
relative
of
them
has
an
inherited
disease
-
is
advised
to
take
up
genetic
testing
.

however
,
-
public
is
very
concern
about
the
safe
operation
of
nuclear
reactors
.

in
order
to
make
engineering
design
product
meet
the
needs
,
first
of
all
,
-
clear
and
unambiguous
definition
of
this
problem
should
be
defined
.

their
focus
,
instead
,
is
directed
at
their
routine
occupational
job
and
their
own
family
matters
and
therefore
,
the
element
of
creative
is
not
part
of
their
daily
life
.

robbers
can
identify
rich
person
just
by
reading
the
rfid
tag
on
the
things
the
person
buys
.

therefore
the
solution
was
specified
and
the
design
process
was
nearing
completion
.

this
could
be
a
serious
security
flaw
;
in
case
the
plutonium
is
stolen
it
could
be
used
to
fuel
nuclear
weapons
.

in
addition
,
-
aging
population
has
not
been
an
area
of
concern
in
the
past
and
only
recently
the
aged
have
formed
a
significant
population
in
developed
countries
.

a
lot
of
money
is
also
spent
on
developing
these
technologies
which
are
still
in
experimental
stage
.

it
is
well-known
that
the
world
is
facing
a
growing
aging
population
and
this
trend
is
unlikely
to
be
reserved
in
the
short
term
.

therefore
,
they
might
turn
to
counterfeit
product
that
may
even
cause
more
harm
to
their
body
.

also
,
msr
will
be
using
thorium
as
fuel
where
thorium
is
so
abundant
in
the
world
as
compare
to
current
technologies
which
mostly
use
coals
as
fuel
where
coals
are
expected
to
last
just
for
another
146years
according
to
energy
information
administration
(
eia
)
.

during
a
design
process
,
designers
do
not
focus
on
human
response
to
the
design
and
there
is
frequent
mismatch
between
the
operators
and
the
designed
machines

in
the
event
of
an
explosion
,
these
products
will
dissipate
into
the
surrounding
.

therefore
,
the
governments
are
funding
for
many
realistic
researches
and
technologies
to
weigh
down
the
deadweigh
loss
of
aging
process
.

health
care
policies
for
the
aged
have
been
getting
numerous
of
notice
in
the
recent
few
years
.

diverting
funds
to
other
areas
can
be
regarded
as
a
better
``
investment
''
by
policy
makers
and
would
aid
in
the
country
's
development
.

surveillance
technology
allow
others
to
monitor
our
daily
activities
and
record
these
data
in
the
form
of
cctv
(
closed-circuit
television
)
images
,
communication
records
and
content
enabling
them
to
have
access
to
our
personal
information
.

for
vhtr
,
the
projected
cost
of
building
a
prototype
of
the
-
reactor
is
around
$
1.1
billion
(
butler
,
2004
,
may
20
)
.

although
the
whole
process
of
making
the
car
is
very
tough
,
the
engineers
were
supported
by
company
,
government
,
and
society
all
the
way
.

it
is
so
important
that
innovation
design
should
be
existing
anywhere
.

therefore
,
coming
up
with
scrubbers
and
nitrogen
oxide
control
devices
that
are
more
cost
and
control
efficient
will
definitely
reduce
a
significant
amount
of
pollutants
emission
.

hopefully
,
the
engineering
design
processes
can
be
further
polished
in
a
short
term
so
as
to
return
engineering
designs
with
higher
quality
.

removing
individual
's
control
over
the
results
will
in
turn
lead
to
freely
accessible
genetic
information
,
causing
social
issues
and
family
dilemma
.

giving
everyone
-
pension
means
that
some
people
's
living
standard
will
be
influenced
but
giving
out
money
based
on
the
fanatical
need
means
everyone
can
live
in
a
good
condition
.

in
conclusion
,
surveillance
technology
such
as
rfid
should
be
used
to
track
people
since
it
helps
-
in
deterring
crimes
and
terrorism
,
monitoring
employees
and
improving
welfare
of
patients
.

with
the
currently
advance
medical
technology
,
we
are
able
to
remedy
and
prevent
diseases
more
effective
.

let
take
a
look
in
singapore
-
policies
nowadays
.

in
addition
,
the
implementation
of
``
wellness
program
''
and
policies
to
create
age-friendly
environment
also
help
in
buffering
the
aging
process
.

even
if
the
elderly
can
support
themselves
,
some
may
argue
that
-
they
pay
taxes
and
should
be
allowed
to
use
these
funds
set
aside
for
them
.

different
countries
have
different
cases
that
can
not
be
talked
together
.

one
current
human
need
that
should
be
given
priority
for
engineering
design
is
to
have
cost
saving
electronics
.

on
the
other
hand
,
for
the
nus
haptic
chair
innovation
process
,
the
researchers
had
successfully
developed
the
chair
for
the
convenience
of
the
deaf
people
in
singapore
.

therefore
,
if
the
government
are
about
to
limit
the
public
spending
on
the
aged
,
a
lot
of
-
young
and
elderly
will
suffer
.

from
fighting
for
independent
-
to
paving
the
way
for
our
generation
today
to
live
in
comfort
,
their
services
are
immeasurable
.

only
after
four
years
did
the
revolutionary
new
computer
be
displayed
at
apple
's
annual
stockholders
'
meeting
(
rogers
,
2003
,
p.144
)
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
development
of
society
calls
for
larger
and
larger
amount
of
energy
,
which
makes
us
in
desperate
need
of
energy
.

in
the
case
of
the
impact
electric
cars
,
the
opinion
leaders
were
the
ones
who
stimulated
the
sales
and
awareness
of
these
cars
(
rogers
,
2003
)
.

however
,
more
emphasis
should
be
placed
on
the
development
of
social
policy
helping
to
alleviate
and
address
concerns
such
as
the
lack
of
financial
support
and
social
care
,
as
it
affects
the
elderly
more
directly
.

the
other
reason
is
that
low-pressure
molten
salts
can
not
cause
a
steam

-

of

not
only
it
is
his
responsibility
to
share
his
genetic
testing
results
with
his
family
(
forrest
k
,

)
,
informing
his
family
members
will
give
them
a
chance
for

well
as

.

in
addition
,
some
company
has
created
solar
technology
advancement
on
military
weapon
and
-
working
greatly
with
the
governments
.

in
my
opinion
,
-
input
of
psychology
in
each
stage
would
be
able
to
change
the
erroneous
part
of
-
design
process
and
effectively
enhance
the
safety
of
a
system
.

electronics
such
as
lights
and
cars
have
become
essential
to
the
human
beings
over
the
past
years
.

we
are
going
to
view
the
definition
and
some
factors
that
make
nuclear
become
a
nuclear
.

thus
,
there
is
no
denying
the
fact
that
the
good
performance
in
singapore
herself
is
a
convincing
illustration
for
limiting
public
expenses
on
the
elderly
and
investing
in
other
fields
such
as
education
and
research
.

military
priority
during
the
world
war
ii
was
an
important
factor
in
propelling
the
design
and
use
of
jet
engine
.

this
two
tier
solution
would
definitely
help
in
the
progress
of
a
country
.

under
this
act
,
it
prohibits
employers
from
making
unfavourable
employment
decisions
and
prohibits
insurance
companies
from
reducing
insurance
coverage
.

the
extent
to
which
limitations
of
public
spending
on
the
aged
has
always
been
a
complicated
issue
in
many
developed
countries
.

this
has
resulted
in
very
different
products
-
developed
by
each
environment
.

despite
the
above
said
,
it
may
be
objected
that
as
the
elderly
had
contributed
significantly
to
the
country
's
development
in
their
younger
days
,
in
view
of
their
long
term
hard
work
,
they
should
be
entitled
with
more
benefits
than
the
rest
of
the
population
.

therefore
,
emotional
reactions
of
relatives
or
parents
are
unpredicted
and
it
depends
on
the
believed
and
mindset
of
relatives
or
parents
of
individuals
.

even
for
the
same
kind
of
material
,
it
might
have
to
be
used
several
times
as
the
parts
fabricated
is
not
necessarily
always
in
the
expected
condition
when
it
is
first
made
,
resulting
in
a
wastage
and
hence
greater
consumption
of
raw
materials
and
therefore
a
greater
cost
incurred
in
the
designing
process
.

secondly
,
there
are
laws
such
as
-
genetic
information
non-discrimination
act
(
gina
)
or
the
health
insurance
portability
and
accountability
act
(

)
(

)
-
which
protect
the
confidentiality
and
interests
of
the
patient
.

the
engineers
produces
in
local
universities
are
not
able
to
fill
the
gap
left
by
the
engineers
who
leave
the
country
.

an
example
is
that
there
has
been
quite
a
number
research
on
the
kind
of
food
which
one
consumes
-
will
help
to
slow
the
aging
process
.

at
the
same
time
,
more
and
more
facilities
are
designed
to
meet
the
needs
of
-
elderly
and
-
disability
.

in
other
words
,
-
world
's
ageing
population
has
the
potential
to
defuse
-
war
on
terrorism
.

some
older
workers
are
earning
minimal
wages
-
thus
they
have
to
take
a
second
job
or
part
time
job
to
boost
their
income
earning
.

a
phone
by
doro
with
big
buttons
and
limited
functions
is
an
example
.

nowadays
,
we
already
have
built
some
solar
powerhouses
but
we
never
hear
anything
unfortunate
happens
.

they
will
have
a
disbursement
of
grant
if
they
live
in
the
same
town
,
or
2
kilometers
apart
from
each
other
if
they
are
to
stay
in

besides
,
such
costs
may
even
be
bigger
than
the
original
cost
of
running
welfare
programs
for
the
elderly
.

among
the
five
senses
,
the
most
common
deteriorations
of
senses
are
-
vision
problems
and
hearing
loss
.

hence
,
the
idea
of
spying
people
by
using
technology
such
as
rfid
has
to
be
banned
.

one
such
example
is
the
healthcare
need
of
the
elderly
.

for
instance
-
free
personal
care
,
such
as
the
washing
and
dressing
of
elderly
people
costs
britain
an
additional
forty
million
pounds
which
caused
its
government
to
adopt
such
policy.2

while
it
is
important
to
care
for
the
aged
,
it
-
is
just
as
important
to
take
into
consideration
and
not
neglect
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

that
is
,
both
are
largely
successful
.

all
the
alternative
energy
-
mentioned
are
green
compared
to
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels
in
terms
of
emission
to
-
environment
.

the
two
main
causes
for
this
problem
are
population
outburst
and
corruption
.

in
north
korea
's
case
,
they
started
the
development
of
nuclear
technology
because
of
the
raise
of
tension
with
south
korea
.

basically
,
families
that
give
birth
to
more
than
one
child
will
get
economic
support
from
child
birth
rate
and
ease
the
ageing
process
.

this
brings
up
the
efficiency
of
the
reactor
by
as
much
as
50
-
percent
(
hecht
,
2008
)
.

in
fact
,
governments
should
only
focus
on
those
elderly
who
are
poor
,
needy
and
abandoned
by
family
.

hence
,
local
engineers
encounter
their
first
major
test
in
their
quest
:
limited
land
spaces
.

there
are
plans
to
scale
up
the
project
to
contribute
30
-
%
of
the
water
supply
by
2010
.

electric
generated
vehicle
will
not
exhaust
gases
when
it
is
being
driven
.

the
success
of
a
technology
not
only
depends
on
how
well
it
resolves
the
targeted
need
but
also
the
social
considerations
it
incurs
when
-
introduced
to
the
consumer
market
.

for
example
,
when
the
families
have
an
average
of
one
child
instead
of
two
or
three
children
,
the
only
child
will
have
a
very
huge
task
and
burden
to
take
care
of
his
or
her
family
in
the
future
.

despite
the
concern
by
the
public
over
the
safe
operation
of
the
nuclear
reactors
being
built
,
there
is
strong
evidence
that
-
very-high-temperature
reactors
(
vhtr
)
,
one
of
the
six
generations
iv
nuclear
reactors
,
could
bring
positive
results
for
further
research
and
development
funding
.

so
economy
cost
became
a
big
concern
.

(
2004
,
-
may
20
)
.

firstly
,
if
the
risk
is
due
to
family
medical
history
such
as
haemophilia
and
huntington
's
disease
(
nih
)
,
then
by
revealing
it
to
relatives
,
more
people
will
know
that
they
could
be
at
risk
too
.

public
spending
on
elderly
healthcare
must
not
be
raised
to
compensate
for
the
failure
of
children
to
look
after
their
parents
.

just
one
week
ago
,
a
case
of
a
daughter
-
cheated
on
her
mother
into
selling
her
apartment
away
and
took
away
the
sum
of
money
,
leaving
her
mother
homeless
on
the
street
.

statistics
show
that
the
numbers
are
only
continuing
to
grow
with
the
existing

explosion
.

the
core
reactor
is
connected
to
an
intermediate
heat
exchanger
to
process
heat
and
is
able
to
output
the
temperature
up
to
1000
degree
celsius
with
more
than
50
%
efficiency
(
``
very-
high-temperature
reactor
''
,
2003
)
.

beside
the
expense
for
societal
aging
,
there
are
also
sponsors
from
the
government
which
need
-
be
diverted
to
other
fields
.

due
to
low
maintenance
,
the
fixed
cost
would
be
lower
in
a
near
future
time
.

the
explosion
finally
led
to
the
evacuation
and
resettlement
of
over
336,000
people
.

plus
,
since
a
lot
of
immigrant
workers
with
different
nationalities
,
their
skills
might
not
be
similar
or
adequate
enough
to
meet
with
the
requirement
of
the
jobs
.

they
should
be
given
every
right
to
receive
education
under
any
circumstances
.

for
example
,
hand
phones
,
computers
,
mp3
and
cameras
have
make
communication
between
people
in
a
distant
more
easily
simply
just
by
a
click
or
a
press
in
the
button
.

however
,
genetic
information
of
an
individual
susceptible
to
a
particular
genetic
disease
inevitably
concerns
family
members
who
usually
also
share
the
same
set
of
genes
.

therefore
,
the
research
in
msr
cost
about
$
1000
million
as
compared
to
vhtr
's
research
which
will
cost
at
$
670
million
as
quoted
from
the
report
on
``
a
technology
roadmap
for
generation
iv
nuclear
energy
system
''
.

the
bca
states
that
``
a
$
40-million
accessibility
fund
had
been
set
aside
to
upgrade
buildings
built
before
1990
.

the
serious
consequences
caused
by
nuclear
leaks
make
the
experts
consider
over
and
over
again
before
ordering
new
nuclear
plants
.

and
singapore
,
as
one
of
the
developed
countries
having
one
of
the
fastest
-
elderly
populations
in
the
world
,
which
had
around
235,000
elderly
population
aged
65
year
old
and
above
(
or7
%
of
the
population
)
in
1999
while
this
figure
being
going
to
reach
796,000
(
or19
%
of
the
population
)
by
the
year
2030
(
committee
on
ageing
issues
,
n.d.
)
,
needs
to
face
this
serious
challenge
and
ease
the
negative
impact
-
on
society
.

helium
is
,
in
fact
,
an
inert
gas
-
.

people
in
the
current
generation
are
healthier
-
,
wealthier
and
better
educated
than
past
generations
.

so
the
technology
which
is
designed
purposively
will
draw
more
attention
.

the
driver
,
nevertheless
,
chose
to
ignore
the
report
until
it
was
too
late
.

we
should
only
focus
on
the
stand
that
these
medical
innovations
do
help
those
who
want
to
age
in
the
way
which
they
define
themselves
in
.

in
this
report
the
concepts
of
very-high-temperature-reactor
(
vhtr
)
are
attention-getting
because
the
new
features
of
vhtr
will
greatly
improve
nuclear
energy
's
popularity
,
thus
resetting
opponents
'
conservative
views
.

although
most
of
the
singaporean
have
to
pay
for
not
only
-
their
own
medical
bills
,
there
are
other
subsidy
schemes
which
may
lesser
their
financial
burden
.

from
the
huge
one
with
the
simplest
function
to
today
's
lovely
and
multi-functional
one
,
electronic
dictronary
have
been
refined
again
and
again
.

however
,
the
united
sates
department
of
homeland
security
(
dhs
)
-
reported
that
the
ability
of
rfid
to
counter
forgery
comes
from
its
use
of
encrypted
digital
data
storage
and
not
from
its
radio
transmission
capability
.

reasons
that
lead
to
hearing
loss
vary
;
it
could
be
``
birth-related
''
,
or
because
of
infections
infections
,
injuries
,
and
being
exposed
in
loud
and
noisy
environment
for
a
long
period
frequently
.

overall
,
governments
should
change
their
focus
on
other
factors
of
the
country
first
before
they
want
to
help
the
elderly
.

recently
,
there
was
an
outbreak
of
a
pandemic
flu
which
started
in
mexico
and
was
spreading
rampantly
around
the
world
and
instilled
fear
in
people
.

aging
,
hence
,
has
becoming
a
popular
issue
that
everyone
is
concerned
about
today
.

limit
spending
on
the
aged
does
not
mean
that
government
should
not
spend
on
them
.

therefore
,
with
good
strategic
planning
by
the
country
and
the
understanding
of
its
citizen
,
limiting
spending
on
the
aged
and
diverting
money
to
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
,
is
feasible
.

besides
that
,
what
did
the
singapore
government
did
was
introduced
the
baby
bonus
schemes
to
the
public
with
the
objective
of
encouraging
the
public
to
have
more
children
.

n.a
.

if
rfid
chip
is
implanted
to
all
members
of
society
,
it
will
give
out
-
a
lot
of
advantages
such
as
we
can
track
missing
people
,
missing
family
members
.

currently
,
the
drug
that
helps
to
reduce
aging
is
being
tested
and
will
be
releasing
into
the
market
soon
.

although
nasa
have
-
to
face
the
pressure
from
the
public
and
the
political
,
they
should
aware
the
consequences
of
the
failure
,
which
might
make
the
situation
even
worse
.

in
conclusion
,
capital
cost
and
the
shortage
of
human
resources
are
two
of
the
problems
which
will
significantly
hamper
engineering
design
process
innovation
,
which
may
result
in
an
impact
of
-
commercialization
stage
unable
to
be
realized
.

conventionally
generated
technologies
and
technologies
in
``
skunk
works
''
are
of
great
difference
while
they
still
have
features
in
common
.

in
fact
,
the
lack
of
professionals
in
engineering
field
results
-
the
failure
of
many
researches
.

immigration
policy
is
a
practical
solution
adopted
by
developed
countries
with
aging
societies
,
namely
,
singapore
,
-
usa
and
china
.

to
sum
up
,
the
generation
iv
reactors
is
a
trend
of
-
21st
century
,
it
will
make
a
great
improvement
and
progress
for
our
life
.

firstly
,
countries
can
help
to
ease
the
aging
process
by
implementing
-
new
policy
of
encouraging
elder
employment
.

hence
,
the
use
of
rfid
to
track
people
should
be
banned
.

however
,
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
as
the
people
should
be
self-reliant
.

a
series
of
experiments
show
that
graphite-based
materials
can
well
-
match
the
temperature
of
molten
salts
which
is
as
high
as
700
to
800
celsius
.

discrimination
in
employment
and
insurance
is
another
reason
why
an
individual
should
possess
the
right
of
disclosing
genetic
result
.

hence
,
in
the
long
run
,
it
is
more
economical
to
adopt
-
lead-coaled
fast
reactor
which
is
also
an
environmental
source
of
energy
.

the
government
needs
to
know
how
to
set
limits
on
the
healthcare
budget
for
the
elderly
.

secondly
,
petrol
resources
are
not
evenly
distributed
around
the
world
.

therefore
,
for
china
,
being
a
country
which
is
much
less
developed
than
japan
,
to
limit
the
spending
on
the
aged
will
be
a
more
wise
decision
.

not
only
that
this
would
pressurize
the
workforce
,
it
would
also
cause
them
to
spend
less
as
they
have
lesser
discretionary
income
.

as
a
result
,
once
everyone
is
deprived
of
deciding
to
keep
their
information
of
genetic
testing
unknown
,
people
who
are
tested
positive
would
be
discriminated
.

and
certainly
,
when
implemented
on
its
own
,
each
policy
presents
its
own
sets
of
problems
.

given
the
memories
of
previous
nuclear
reactor
accidents
,
the
public
concerns
a
lot
about
the
safety
of
nuclear
plants
.

nonetheless
,
the
advantages
generation
iv
nuclear
power
,
specifically
-
very-high-
temperature
reactor
(
vhtr
)
,
could
provide
can
offset
its
high
start
up
cost
and
overcome
its
disadvantages
.

if
the
former
need
is
put
forward
to
an
engineer
,
he
can
view
it
as
a
broad
topic
with
many
possible
solutions
.

the
main
reason
for
this
phenomenon
is
that
money
needs
to
be
spent
on
the
aged
now
so
as
to
ease
the
aging
process
-
if
not
-
years
down
the
road
,
public
spending
might
have
to
increase
significantly
as
compared
to
now
due
to
the
lack
of
progress
on
the
spending
on
the
aged
.

)
originated
from
asian
cultures
,
family
obligation
is
the
most
precious
thing
,
which
characterizes
the
parents-children
relationship
.

for
example
,
many
european
countries
such
as
denmark
,
sweden
and
cyprus
allocate
nearly
7
%
of
their
gdp
into
public
investment
in
education
.

with
all
these
concurrent
efforts
by
bca
,
mobility
has
improved
vastly
for
the
elderly
.

this
then
bought
about
the
debates
on
whether
surveillance
technology
should
be
banned
or
not
as
it
indeed
provides
security
,
but
it
also
invades
our
privacy
and
disturbs
the
society
.

the
working
temperature
is
about
510-550k
and
-
pressure
is
25mpa
(
butler
,
d
)
.there
is
many
people
will
feel
shocking
with
the
high
operating
temperature
and
pressure
of
this
reactor
.

calculation
were
done
to
show
that
lfr
has
a
better
safety
design
mainly
because
lead
served
as
a
better
coolant
that
does
not
react
as
readily
as
compared
to
sodium
and
air
.

because
of
the
influence
of
energy
,
the
natural
resources
have
invisibly
caused
wars
and
conflicts
between
many
countries
over
years
and
years
.

this
is
extremely
efficient
as
compared
to
the
conventional
thermal
power
station
methods
.

as
rogers
stated
-
in
his
book
,
development
of
technologies
is
stimulated
either
by
scientific
research
or
by
social
reasons
.

thus
,
-
aging
population
is
now
a
rising
problem
globally
.

therefore
,
japan
needs
to
ease
up
on
its
immigration
laws
by
allowing
more
foreigners
to
immigrate
,
in
order
to
solve
the
problems
.

the
aging
issue
of
population
worldwide
had
never
been
so
pressing
until
recently
the
large
population
of
the
baby
boomers
generation
is
due
to
welcoming
their
golden
years
.

instead
,
they
should
be
enhanced
for
general
benefits
,
without
sacrificing
something
for
the
other
which
in
this
case
,
sacrificing
the
aged
is
obviously
doubted
as
a
noble
reaction
from
the
government
.

hence
,
the
high
one-time
economic
input
does
not
seem
to
be
a
problem
compared
with
the
high
efficiency
and
the
significant
side
product
of
the
vhtr
system
.

the
operating
cost
of
the
plant
includes
its
daily
running
and
also
the
disposal
of
the
waste
.

engineer
can
increase
the
wide
of
the
base
of
the
structure
to
support
-
extra
level
of
building
build
on
it
.

moreover
,
without
the
government
's
support
for
the
elderly
,
the
burden
of
caring
for
these
elderly
will
fall
solely
on
the
``
sandwich
generation
''
-
,
whereby
the
individuals
are
to
be
financially
responsible
for
their
family
,
children
and
parents
.

there
are
various
ways
generating
electricity
.

the
ban
of
surveillance
technology
should
not
be
imposed
on
.

there
exists
a
remarkable
fact
which
is
that
a
technical
innovation
is
viewed
different
between
different
groups
of
people
.

political
factors
such
as
government
decision
and
military
demands
could
also
shaped
technological
innovation
.

but
this
does
not
imply
to
certain
countries
that
expect
the
people
to
work
for
them
.

for
example
,
it
was
reported
recently
that
the
singapore
state-owned
investment
company
,
temasek
holdings
,
has
lost
over
$
us4
billion
on
its
investments
in
organisations
such
as
merrill
lynch
.

last
,
engineering
design
processes
can
help
to
reduce
the
waste
of
energy
.

therefore
,
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
to
prevent
over
reliance
on
the
government
and
that
more
emphasis
could
be
made
to
other
sectors
to
promote
economic
growth
.

examples
-
lift
upgrading
,
slopes
for
wheel
chairs
and
old
folk
corner
.

to
suggest
,
a
country
can
implant
financial
survey
for
the
elderly
.

if
the
public
spending
on
the
solutions
are
limited
,
thus
effects
of
these
solutions
will
not
be
able
to
meet
our
expectations
.

there
might
be
one
day
that
the
country
's
work
force
can
no
longer
support
the
extremely
high
amount
of
public
spending
.

we
should
interpret
this
information
as
a
means
of
relief
to
the
government
's
handouts
.

as
to
the
potential
terrorism
attract
,
we
can
build
solid
reactor
as
well
as
emphasis
anti-terrorism
in
a
global
level
.

economy
growth
is
vital
to
a
country
as
with
a
good
economy
,
it
increases
government
revenue
.

such
short
using
age
of
the
battery
together
with
some
other
reasons
leaded
to
a
few
cases
of
patients
'
death
because
of
-
running
out
of
energy
in
advance
.

on
the
whole
,
-
singapore
government
have
not
overlooked
the
underprivileged
senior
citizens
by
providing
-
safety
net
to
ensure
-
their
basic
needs
are
met
.

the
vhtr
can
reduce
the
occurrence
of
this
incident
by
incorporating
-
simple
cooling
system
which
does
not
need
skilled
operators
(
butler
,
2004
)
.

the
need
for
more
sophisticated
technologies
to
reverse
this
damage
caused
to
our
environment
has
set
engineers
racing
against
the
clock
.

as
the

the

saw

it

graying
population
has
created
pressure
for
-
younger
generation
as
the
ratio
of
young
adults
supporting
one
elderly
has
been
constantly
decreasing
.

thus
,
it
is
crucial
for
the
government
to
spend
more
public
fund
in
dealing
with
medical
problems
of
the
aged
.

all
these
steps
are
to
be
done
during
the
designing
stage
,
which
means
that
the
psychology
approach
will
play
an
important
role
.

nuclear
power
technology
is
much
more
well-rounded
and
practical
technology
when
compared
to
solar
power
or
bio-power
technology
.

for
example
,
a
small
device
called
hearing
aid
is
a
solution
for
the
hearing
loss
problem
of
the
elderly
.

he
does
n't
have
the
right
-
to
disclose
it
.

the
advantages
of
the
nuclear
power
plant
are
more
than
the
disadvantages
.

in
order
to
combat
the
shrinking
workforce
,
caused
by
the
rapid
ageing
population
and
a
declining
fertility
rate
,
the
health
authorities
must
first
gear
up
their
medical
field
and
prepare
for
an
aging
population
.

fortunately
,
the
designers
of
-
laptop
were
strong-minded
so
people
nowadays
are
able
to
access
internet
anywhere
with
laptops
that
were
first
invented
by
them
.

as
a
result
,
governments
and
policy
makers
around
the
world
are
ready
to
set
aside
a
larger
portion
of
their
countries
'
budget
to
cater
for
age-related
spending
,
with
healthcare
for
-
elderly
as
most
of
their
top
priority
.

even
though
electric-powered
vehicles
were
relatively
more
superior
in
the
technicalities
,
due
to
the
factors
mentioned
above
,
the
technicalities
were
marginal
and
people
were
not
affected
by
the
potential
problems
they
might
face
if
they
choose
the
gasoline-powered
vehicles
.

maybe
it
would
be
take
a
few
more
years
before
the
eco-car
have
a
potential
to
be

this
further
supports
the
need
for
research
and
development
on
molten
salt
reactor
.

the
developments
of
current
researches
,
especially
in
the
field
of
science
and
technology
have
benefitted
the
older
population
greatly
as
the
problems
faced
by
the
aging
population
are
alleviated
by
the
research
.

in
conclusion
,
i
strongly
disagree
in
the
usage
of
surveillance
technology
because
it
is
a
invasion
to
privacy
,
it
does
not
really
reduce
crime
rates
and
it
raises
a
problem
related
to
health
issues
.

the
first
step
is
to
identify
the
problem
,
which
usually
involves
the
process
of
knowing
what
the
customer
wants
and
what
problems
are
they
encountering
with
existing
products
.

in
the
21st
century
,
everything
develops
in
a
very
fast
pace
.

for
example
,
singapore
government
has
introduced
several
measures
to
boost
the
fertility
rate
.

take
the
aspect
of
electric
devices
as
an
example
,
-
refrigerator
was
studied
for
a
long
time
in
the
laboratory
after
people
had
the
desire
of
reserving
things
in
a
cold
temperature
longer
.

another
instance
could
be
the
upgrading
of
roads
to
cater
to
the
increasing
amount
of
vehicles
,
-
to
reduce
road
congestion
.

since
the
disclosure
might
bring
negative
effects
to
the
individual
's
family
and
induce
discrimination
in
employment
as
well
as
the
purchase
of
insurance
,
i
would
like
to
agree
with
the
statement
of
having
right
to
decide
the
revealing
of
genetic
test
result
.

there
should
be
a
limitation
for
the
public
spending
on
the
aged
.

development
in
sports
such
as
hosting
the
youth
olympic
games
will
be
a
great
boost
to
the
tourism
sector
as
the
games
is
expected
to
generate
a
minimum
of
more
than
150,000
visitors
per
night
for
singapore
(
patwant
singh
,
2008
)
.

once
they
are
used
to
with
the
current
product
,
it
is
hard
to
persuade
them
to
switch
to
the
new
one
because
they
have
to
learn
how
to
use
the
new
device
.

furthermore
,
foreign
investors
will
not
set
up
factories
in
countries
that
are
equipped
with
-
poorly
educated
workforce
.

public
policies
assist
the
continuation
of
national

such

policy
can
give
securities
for
the
elderly
if
they
find
themselves
trapped
with

high
cost
of

.

all
these
harmful
effects
bring
us
to
this
certain
human

that
should
be
given
the
utmost
priority
-
health

if

its

rise

finally
it

to
lengthen

lifespan
,
the
government
introduced
policies
to
reduce
elder
dependency
by
raising

age
for

and

.

therefore
its
bias
to
say
that

threatens

to
a
huge
extent
.

public

,

and
all
the
services
for
the
elderly
are
the
least
we
can
do
to
pay
our
debt
of
gratitude
to
what
they
have
done
for
us
.

today
,
even
as
many
other
countries
have
taken
small
steps
towards
the
control
of
greenhouse
emissions
,
the
fact
remains
that
a
large
portion
of
the
energy
we
generate
for
human
consumption
still
comes
from
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels
.

this
reinforces
the
possibility
that
the
scwr
can
not
enter
the
commercialization
stage
of
innovation
,
proving
that
there
should
not
be
funding
for
the
development
of
-
scwr
.

therefore
,
the
society
should
be
aware
of
its
situation
and
address
to
this
problem
before
it
becomes
a
severe
issue
for
the
country
.

having
quality
health
care
services
at
affordable
prices
is
viewed
as
one
of
the
most
important
need
for
the
aging
population
.

infact
the
refuelling
in
this
type
of
reactor
can
be
achieved
when
it
is
still
running.it
is
so
highly
efficient
that
a
single
pebble
can
last
upto
three
years
.

this
means
that
it
is
able
to
provide
makeup
water
to
cool
the
reactor
in
the
event
where
lack
of
coolant
and
therefore
there
will
not
be
a
significant
rise
in
the
temperature
easily
.

until
the
1980s
,
due
to
the
cellular
idea
,
the
portability
and
the

improved

this
can
prove
beneficial
to
the
elderly
as
significant
changes
in
living
standards
are
achieved
.

even
though
technological
advances
proves
to
be
a
marvel
as
we
move
faster
into
the
future
,
it
does
not
only
bring
about
benefits
but
also
negative
repercussions
if
not
dealt
with
properly
.

with
so
many
issues
to
be
considered
,
it
is
certain
that
the
funding
available
will
never
be
sufficient
.

therefore
,
if
may
seems
that
nuclear
-
is
a
cheaper
alternative
.

elders
can
be
at
ease
knowing
that
they
are
able
to
be
more
financially
capable
at

also
,
with
-
support
of
countries
such
as

,
and

,
the
cost
of
research
is
shared

therefore
,
the
public

not
fear
of
the
robotic

should
give
confident
and
trust

the
technologies

other
than
making
the
lift
accessible
to
all
levels
,
conscientious
efforts
have
been
done
to
further
simplify
the
lives
of
the
elders
.

automations
such
as
dish-washer
allow
-
elderly
to
do
simple
chores
at
home
and
it
increases
the
level
of
independence
of
the
elderly
at
homes
or
even
out
to
the
society
.

there
is
a
profound
need
for
a
new
generation
of
nuclear
reactor
as
it
not
only
brings
a
cleaner
energy
for
our
future
generation
but
it
is
also
a
waste-free
,
terrorism-proof
and
affordable
source
of
energy
.

instead
,
(
lfr
)
can
ultimately
have
the
lowest
cost
among
all
other
kinds
of
reactor
because
intermediate
coolant
loop
is
redundant
for
it
.

however
,
except
for
electricity
generation
,
the
future
gfr
is
predicted
to
achieve
an
excellent
thermal
performance

on

direct

therefore
this
act
is
rather
ineffective
in
solving
the
problems
of
unwanted

and
in

it

the
laptop
is
indeed
an
important
technology
that
is
shaped
by
economic
and
military
factors
,
and
consumer
demands
.

however
,
solely
focusing
on
the
aged
population
would
not
be
the
best
approach
.

it
is
only
when
the
public
get
to
know
about
it
then
will
you
face
discrimination
.

the
vast
increase
in
-

has
leaded

economic
to
the

most
of
the
private

may
also
lack

materials
for

and

therefore
,
due

should
not

now
their
citizens
are
able
to
enjoy

which
means
that
they
will
be

.

the
data
has
also
showed
that
stressful
working
life
is
contributing
to
the
poor
health
of
the
people
.

the
following
is
an
example
of
using
engineering
design
process
as
an
approach
to
solve
the
problem
.

motorola
8900
which
was
available
in
market
in
the
year
1995
was
firstly
featured
with
a
cover
so
that
miss-press
of
button
was
avoided
.

grooming
then
,
comes
in
the
form
of
a
more
sophisticated
infrastructure
for
learning
and
monetary
incentives
or
aids
in
-
scholarships
and
bursaries
.

there
are
some
products
which
directly
copy
the
design
of
foreign
companies
.

the
similarities
between
them
come
next
.

it
is
,
however
,
maybe
approached
from
another
angle
that
a
constant
proportion
of
-
gdp
of
a
country
to
support
the
old
people
is
maintained
.

the
culture
in
singapore
does
not
even
allow
our
workers
to
make
time
for
this
crucial
concept
generation
process
.

social
policies
,
practices
and
attitudes
discourage
working
at
an
older
age
because
the
retirement
for
-
elderly
will
be
costly
for
firms
.

however
,
the
policy
of
engineering
and
industry
can
not
meet
the
needs
.

these
examples
show
that
even
the
machine
errors
can
be
eliminated
by
carefully
design
and
applying
psychology
in
the
design
process
to
predict
all
the
cases
that
may
happen
in
the
future
.

thus
,
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
and
the
money
should
be
diverted
to
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

the
engineers
keep
working
and
working
,
trial
and
error
,
wishing
to
invent
a
best
seller
and
have
a
good
benefit
.

the
poor
quality
of
products
hamper
the
interests
of
customers
and
yet
affect
the
fame
of
the
famous
company
.

another
major
difference
is
the
length
of
time
used
on
the
research
.

with
the
growing
population
and
various
problems
that
the
present
governments
face
today
,
the
governments
are
finding
it
tedious
to
balance
the
budget
to
ensure
that
all
areas
of
development
are
being
met
.

all
in
all
,
it
is
the
low
level
of
technological
base
and
the
lack
of
excellent
researchers
that
significantly
hamper
the
whole
process
for
innovation
.

nevertheless
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
ageing
population
is
likely
to
hurt
public
finances
,
it
is
crucial
to
recognize
the
well-being
and
livelihood
of
the
aged
can
not
be
compromise
by
investing
in
other
developments
for
economic
gains
.

it
can
bring
great
economic
benefit
.

as
such
,
i
agree
that
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
so
that
funds
can
be
diverted
to
other
areas
like
-
ministry
of
finance
,
education
,
health
and
national
development
.

besides
the
infrastructure
construction
,
another
advisable
method
to
increase
production
is
to
mechanize
the
agriculture
system
.

although
it
has
resulted
in
a
sounding
success
,
the
technology
has
not
been
widely
implemented
due
to
patents
of
the
technology
being
filed
by
the
parent
companies
.

henceforth
,
to
meet
the
world
's
energy
needs
,
scientists
are
re-addressing
the
potential
benefits
from
harnessing
power
through
nuclear
reaction
,
in
which
uranium
is
splitted
to
release
energy
.

the
accident
happened
in
1986
,
which
was
during
the
cold
war
(
1945-1991
)
.

thus
,
human
are
safe
from
the
radioactivity
produced
by
the
nuclear
waste
.

besides
,
moral
value
especially
to
make
the
children
beholden
to
their
parents
can
be
inculcated
by
introducing
the
appropriate
modules
in
their
education
.

unfortunately
,
no
one
intends
to
pull
the
emergency
brake
during
the
emergency
condition
.

this
means
-
the
time
and
money
required
to
do
the
research
for
sfr
is
much
less
than
that
of
swcr
.

so
when
some
original
designs
and
innovations
come
out
in
china
,
it
is
more
likely
for
them
to
be
ignored
and
discarded
.

from
the
article
``
doomsday
predications
about
population
aging
-
are
exaggerated
written
by
robert
b.friedland
and
laura
summer
''
,
it
stated
out
that
with
little
economic
growth
,
society
faces
fewer
choices
on
how
to
care
for
those
who
are
least
able
to
care
for
themselves
.

size
is
also
one
of
the
factors
to
be
considered
because
too
heavy
will
not
be
appropriate
to
allow
a
patient
to
bring
along
to
everywhere
.

also
,
the
amount
of
nuclear
waste
that
will
be
generated
is
greater
than
that
generated
by
the
lfr
(
oecd
nuclear
energy
agency
,
2009
)
.

this
would
cripple
the
economy
of
singapore
,
which
already
affected
by
the
aging
population
as
well
as
shrinking
workforce
,
further
as
more
money
will
be
spent
on
the
aged
at
the
expense
of
the
other
developments
of
singapore
.

for
some
elderly
person
,
public
spending
is
the
only
source
of
their
income
.

today
,
many
-
medicines
have
been
created
to
treat
cancers
or
other
health
problems
.

in
-
molten
salt
reactor
,
a
better
or
at
least
the
same
system
will
be
used
to
ensure
the
safety
of
the
reactor
.

since
the
scwr
safety
system
is
comparable
with
-
abwr
,
scientists
now
are
trying
to
combine
-
scwr
with
esbwr-type
passive
safety
systems
together
.

the
fact
that
it
may
cause
serious
troubles
for
financial
resources
and
-
caring
from
young
generation
when
the
aging
population
changes
rapidly
urges
people
to
alter
the
way
they
support
themselves
.

the
safety
was
also
a
main
concern
in
this
technological
innovation
.

therefore
,
the
government
should
not
neglect
the
healthcare
benefits
for
the
aged
as
the
consequence
is
undesirable
.

also
,
the
new
alarm
system
and
window
grills
can
also
ensure
a
higher
level
of
security
in
their
area
.

actually
,
a
camera
phone
is
a
combination
of
the
digital
camera
and
the
videophone
which
can
take
pictures
and
save
the
picture
in
digital
form
freely
at
anywhere
and
anytime
as
a
digital
camera
and
transfer
the
pictures
or
videos
to
others
as
a
videophone
.

multi-factorial
diseases
such
as
coronary
heart
diseases
may
occur
in
isolation
,
with
affected
children
born
to
unaffected
parents
.

results
of
many
research
have
revealed
that
there
are
certain
components
which
help
to
maintain
a
healthy
cell
like
antioxidants
,
enzymes
,
hormones
or
``
no
cellular
waste
''
(
dr.

,
``
strategies

negligible
senescence

,

)
...
.

also
,
the
design
has
biocompatible
properties
to
human
beings
tissues
,
because
the
intra-articular
longitudinal
fibers
allow
for
tissue
in
growth
.

thus
,
substantial
increases
in
economic
growth
would
be
needed
to
offset
the
increase
costs
of
aging
(
visco
,
2008
)
.

among
the
different
age
groups
,
the
elderly
population
is
at
the
highest
risk
for
adverse
events
-
such
as
falling
down
at
home
,
due
to
poor
health
and
chronic
conditions
.

it
is
quite
a
pity
to
limit
the
public
spending
on
the
elderly
regarding
some
of
the
disadvantages
that
are
brought
by
such
policy
.

those
who
are
more
affluent
might
migrate
causing
a
loss
of
investors
and
talent
which
affects
the
country
-
development
.

then
,
another
question
rise
:
what
hamper
innovations
in
engineering
design
?

when
there
was
a
surge
of
power
,
they
tried
to
put
back
control
rods
,
hoped
that
-
power
level
could
be
lowered
.

the
social
policies
adopted
have
greatly
introduced
the
older
population
into
the
workforce
and
the
volunteering
sector
,
thus
keeping
them
actively
involved
in
the
community
and
easing
the
aging
process
to
a
large
extent
.

on
the
contrary
,
some
people
might
think
that
using
shielding
techniques
on
rfid
tags
is
already
an
effective
protection
mechanism
against
data
theft
and
data
corruption
(
syed
&
mohammad
,
2008
)
.

this
is
because
there
is
still
a
need
to
contribute
to
the
country
's
economic
growth
in
order
to
be
able
to
sustain
the
well-being
of
its
people
.

besides
that
,
it
is
also
important
for
the
relatives
to
have
psychological
preparation
earlier
so
that
they
are
managed
handle
their
stresses
during
the
period
of
treatments
.

on
september
4th
,
2009
,
a
piece
of
startling
news
was
popped
up
and
quickly
spread
out
all
over

m.d

funds
placed
in
these
aspects
can
help
ease
the
ageing
process
in
the
long
run
,
critically
looking
at
minimizing
the
dependency
of
the
aged
on
the
governments
.

every
country
has
own
features
.

whether
china
can
take
this
chance
to
catch
up
with
those
well-developed
countries
or
even
surpass
them
depends
on
china
's
trail
of
solving
the
present
problems
.

personally

such
as

of
an
individual
carrying

without
the
requirements
of
cheaper

cleaner

and
the
governmental
support
,
it
might
not
-
as
well-developed
as
now
.

ethics
of
genetic
testing
:
medical
insurance
and
genetic
discrimination
.

a
few
examples
include
,
gm
developing
the
first
electric
car
named
impact
,
apple
developing
their
first
macintosh
computer
and
xerox
's
attempt
at
developing
the
world
's
first
personal
computer
.

in
other
words
,
there
will
be
one
elderly
(
aged
above
65
)
found
in
every
five
residents
.

according
to
khandani
(
2005
)
'engineering
design
process
'
is
a
sequence
of
steps
to
design
a
product
in
a
systematic
order
.

once
the
construction
cost
has
been
earned
back
,
the
rest
of
the
years
would
be
a
benefit
to
the
consumers
.

firstly
,
the
main
problem
of
aging
population
-
is
that
the
children
do
not
want
to
take
care
of
their
parents
when
they
are
old
,
because
they
think
that
parents
are
troubles
for
them
,
since
they
are
old
and
unable
to
contribute
.

according
to
the
friedland
and
summer
(
2005
)
,
if
a
nation
spend
more
on
the
aged
,
besides
slowing
down
the
growth
of
the
nation
,
it
will
also
create
more
costly
problems
in
future
.

another
challenge
that
the
innovators
need
to
be
concern
about
is
commercializing
the
finalize
products
.

some
of
the
facilities
provided
by
the
singapore
government
was
the
provision
of
park
connectors
more
facilities
near
working
industries
and
central
business
district
which
allows
working
people
to
enjoy
working
and
still
have
a
good
quality
of
life
.

rogers
,
e.m.
(
2003
-
)
.

such
an
approach
enables
engineers
to
think
out
of
the
bounder
and
challenge
the
old
conventions
,
and
subsequently
forges
innovative
breakthroughs
in
fields
,
like
transportation
system
-
construction
,
that
have
hardly
experienced
any
remarkable
advancement
for
decades
.

although
there
is
no
nuclear
incidence
happen
in
recent
years
,
it
is
too
biased
to
say
that
the
engineering
psychology
can
solved
the
problems
by
itself
.

the
government
should
divert
the
money
into
education
to
equip
the
people
with
the
right
attitude
and
working
skills
,
so
as
to
ensure
a
stable
economy
growth
for
the
country
.

for
instance
,
it
is
more
safe
now
for
patients
who
have
mental
lost
or
mental
diseases
if
they
are
lost
,
because
they
are
being
tracked
all
the
time
in
the
hospital
under
the
surveillance
system
like
rfid
.

there
have
been
many
proposed
strategies
,
policies
and
researches
that
acts
to
target
people
of
all
ages
in
alleviating
the
effects
of
a
greying
population
.

such
is
preferred
than
making
corrections
only
after
-
accident
-
occurred
.

however
,
the
benefits
of
-
surveillance
should
not
be
downplayed
.

naturally
,
for
those
who
ca
n't
afford
it
-
,
we
should
extend
help
funded
by
public
generosity
.
''

the
maintenance
of
parents
act
is
one
good
example
of
government
intervention
to
make
taking
care
of
elderly
mandatory
when
necessary
.

singapore
is
presently
building
an
education
hub
in
asia
,
investing
millions
of
funds
to
boost
her
image
and
economy
.

therefore
,
they
would
rather
hire
a
-
worker
with
higher
qualifications
,
who
is
more
competent
,
and
most
importantly
,
younger
.

if
[
individuals
]
do
n't
have
adequate
coverage
-
,
there
will
be
a
tremendous
strain
on
subsidized
care
which
will
drain
revenues
from
the
state
.

though
activities
held
by
the
above
organizations
ranged
from
learning
history
,
stance
to
acquiring
leadership
,
not
many
students
were
benefited
from
them
.

this
essay
will
examine
three
major
factors
in
the
development
of
-
mobile
telecommunication
in
different
stages
.

the
second
step
in
the
design
process
is
the
gathering
of
information
.

if
he
chose
to
give
safety
the
most
priority
,
he
would
have
pulled
the
emergency
brake
and
the
accident
could
probably
be
prevented
.

one
such
method
is
increased
focus
on
education
.

bibliography

today
,
the
concerns
involved
with
the
ageing
process
have
been
curbed
in
a
wide
array
and
a
majority
of
our
concerns
with
a
greying
population
are
dismissed
.

hence
,
this
thus
send
a
signal
to
phone
manufacturers
--
-the
public
is
more
than
willing
to
accept
a
phone
with
more
functions
and
will
not
even
mind
to
replace
their
previous
models
for
newer
ones
with
added
features
or
functions
.

to
add
on
,
declining
spending
on
the
aged
could
have
roused
social
problems
.

however
,
by
doing
so
,
it
will
increase
the
dependency
of
the
young
adults
on
the
government
to
help
support
their
parents
.

robert
b.
friedland
and
laura
summer
(
2005
)
mentioned
public
policies
that
encourage
and
facilitate
education
,
basic
research
,
and
the
application
of
promising
technologies
can
enhance
the
well-being
of
current
and
future
generation
of
older
people
-
.

such
liability
will
only
discourage
the
older
ones
and
thus
create
an
invisible
segregation
between
the
strong
and
the
weak
.

with
the
portion
of
money
saved
,
it
can
be
used
in
other
areas
of
developments
,
which
will
bring
about
a
better
living
environment
for
the
people
.

besides
,
long-
term
medical
bills
due
to
chronic
diseases
are
too
expensive
that
they
undermine
an
average
income
person
's
total
wealth
.

many
would
agree
that
the
sophisticated
surveillance
technology
has
indeed
been
beneficial
in
the
security
arena
especially
after
the
september
11th
incident
and
government
has
since
then
diverts
their
attention
to
tracking
potential
terrorists
instead
of
tracking
explosive
devices
or
substances
.

in
conclusion
,
the
individual
with
the
positive
result
in
genetic
testing
which
shows
he
or
she
is
a
carrier
of
a
known
genetic
risk
should
reveal
-
due
to
responsible
,
prevention
and
public
issues
.

as
a
result
,
workers
tend
to
pay
less
attention
to
the
details
and
surroundings
and
are
more
incline
to
erroneous
action
which
,
in
this
case
-
posed
great
dangers
.

the
main
argument
to
support
the
banning
is
the
risk
of
identity
theft
.

such
improvements
indisputably
made
our
lives
more
enjoyable
and
our
works
more
effective
.

the
long
shipping
time
and
greater
cost
due
to
importing
of
raw
materials
delayed
the
engineering
design
process
as
they
only
have
a
plan
of
the
race
car
but
no
chance
to
physically
fabricate
the
parts
and
build
the
car
,
while
the
raw
materials
are
still
on
their
way
to
singapore
another
problem
which
could
greatly
affect
the
engineering
process
for
designing
is
a
lack
of
funding
.

it
indirectly
affect
the
pharmaceutical
companies
.

most
people
claim
that
accidents
are
unpreventable
because
a
malfunction
in
a
product
is
due
to
inadequate
design
that
might
cause
accidents
to
occur
-
which
is
beyond
the
control
of
human
capability
(
wilpert
,
2007
)
.

the
length
of
-
tank
's
history
is
almost
one
hundred
year
since
1916
when
the
first
time
tank
was
used
as
a
secret
weapon
of
-
british
.

for
instance
,
the
discovery
of
penicillin
,
though
a
big
serendipitous
observation
,
still
costs
as
many
of
financial
supports
as
the
discovery
of
vaccine
.

as
the
world
's
energy
demand
is
on
the
rise
,
the
world
-
has
to
look
into
alternatives
to
solve
this
issue
.

this
is
because
the
emotional
stability
of
the
relatives
in
question
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration
,
as
not
every
person
in
the
family
would
develop
the
disease
even
if
there
have
a
particular
mutation
that
puts
them
at
a
higher
risk
of
developing
the
disease
.

other
than
that
,
the
elderly
must
also
play
their
part
by
creating
more
awareness
to
the
society
and
participating
actively
in
the
policies
or
devices
produce
for
them
.

in
many
countries
,
the
proportion
-
of
older
people
is
steadily
increasing
.

another
component
is
copper
.

for
example
,
cognitive
psychology
focuses
on
ways
to
improve
memory
and
how
to
increase
decision-making
accuracy
and
-
social
psychology
are
interested
in
the
impact
that
social
environment
and
interaction
has
on
attitudes
and
behaviors
(
kendra
,
v.w
.

meanwhile
,
the
outcomes
of
robotic
surgery
also
reveal
that
it
is
a
safe
surgery
method
.

however
,
only
after
seventy
three
seconds
into
-
flight
,
the
challenger
exploded
and
all
seven
of
its
crew
were
lost
.

in
the
face
of
-
limited
budget
,
the
public
spending
,
however
,
should
give
priorities
to
necessary
schemes
and
identify
which
cost
can
be
reduced
in
order
to
make
the
best
choice
.

first
of
all
,
the
current
car
's
technology
,
the
fuel
injection
-
has
satisfied
humans
'
need
to
travel
.

in
conclusion
,
current
research
and
development
,
and
policies
have
certainly
helped
to
ease
the
aging
process
to
a
large
extent
.

in
the
context
of
singapore
,
being
small
,
other
than
taking
diplomatic
approach
,
she
also
has
to
make
sure
her
economy
is
strong
and
attractive
for
foreign
countries
or
companies
to
invest
in
.

the
passenger
tried
to
warn
the
crew
but
was
refused
by
the
train
manager
due
to
the
reason
that
he
needs
to
investigate
the
problem
by
himself
first
.

second
,
in
contrast
with
the
benefit
which
the
fuel
injection
has
contributed
to
humans
'
life
,
it
has
-
polluted
the
environment
.

copper
has
good
electrical
conductivity
which
allows
the
conductor
channel
lengths
and
widths
to
be
significantly
reduced
.

with
this
additional
economic
revenue
generated
by
the
talents
,
more
public
funding
can
be
channeled
to
help
the
aged
.

(
www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ahcd/agingtrends/05medicine.pdf
)

majority
of
these
elderly
are
the
baby
boomers
who
yearn
to
extend
their
duration
in
the
workforce
.

although
some
argue
that
rfid
technology
that
stores
one
's
information
in
rfid
such
as
credit
card
or
identity
card
provides
great
convenience
,
it
creates
chances
for
criminals
as
well
at
the
same
time
.

another
alarming
fact
is
that
,
even
singapore
which
implements
strong
traffic
laws
and
regulations
is
also
affected
by
this
traffic
accident
problem
.

when
people
are
provided
with
social
services
that
allow
them
to
maintain
a
living
,
they
are
less
inclined
to
work
(
esping-andersen
,
1990
)
.

the
vhtr
's
potential
as
the
best
nuclear
reactor
is
recognized
by
many
countries
like
france
,
japan
and
-
united
states
of
america
.

research
by
kloosterman
(
2009
)
,
shows
that
common
antibiotic
treatment
has
the
ability
to
cure
genetic
diseases
such
as
cystic
fibrosis
,
a
type
of
genetic
lung
disease
.

in
such
small
nations
(
in
terms
of
geographical
area
)
like
singapore
,
this
issue
is
particularly
important
because
every
climatic
change
or
pollution
problem
is
likely
to
negatively
affect
the
whole
country
,
especially
-
physical
health
of
-
people
,
including
the
aged
.

in
conclusion
,
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
so
as
to
prevent
incurring
heavy
financial
expenditures
,
and
the
spreading
of
the
'welfare
diseases
'
that
-
undermine
the
incentive
to
work
.

one
of
which
is
to
increase
public
spending
so
as
to
ensure
that
the
aged
are
taken
care
-
.

without
the
awareness
of
recognizing
or
discovering
the
problems
,
the
innovation
process
can
not
proceed
smoothly
.

as
a
result
,
heated
fuel
will
be
disposed
of
immediately
without
-
threatening
an
explosion
or
leakage
(
joseph
&
angelo
,
2005
)
.

catastrophic
incidents
always
take
-
a
series
of
mistakes
to
happen
where
human
errors
usually
play
a
main
part
(
b.wilpert
,
2007
)
.

however
,
there
are
initiatives
such
as
comcare
fund
,
which
assists
the
less
privileged
group
in
singapore
.

in
fact
,
there
are
a
lot
of
potentials
rise
,
but
seldom
is
developed
;
as
a
result
,
indonesia
is
running
out
of
qualified
human
resources
.

however
,
a
countdown
timer
has
been
installed
beside
the
'green
man
'
to
signal
to
the
pedestrians
that
the
traffic
light
is
turning
to
'red
man
'
.

it
was
only
with
success
did
the
formula
racing
car
received
funding
from
sponsors
.

these
efforts
have
proven
to
be
effective
.

nowadays
people
argue
about
the
safety
issues
and
economic
cost
of
nuclear
power
generation
and
they
doubt
about
its
ability
to
go
against
climate
change
as
well
,
which
is
asserted
-
by
some
scientists
.

we
are
using

funding

as
the
lifecycle
of
human
beings
is
irreversible
,
human
life
expectancy
is
heavily
depends
on
the
rate
of
aging
.

the
concept
of
generation
iv
nuclear
energy
system
(
nes
)
is
able
to
meet
this
demand
and
is
inevitable
in
implementation
.

these
policies
have
indeed
eased
the
aging
problem
.

we
could
not
rely
on
the
government
as
they
too
have
other
areas
of
development
to
look
out
for
.

in
my
opinion
,
in
these
modern
technologies
in
medical
equipments
,
for
example
,
robotic
surgery
system
,
help
to
extend
the
lifespan
of
one
human
being
.

genetic
disorders
are
caused
by
the
mutation
of
a
gene
(
letsou
,
2009
)
.when
a
normal
gene
is
mutated
,
its
stability
will
no
longer
be
maintained
.

it
really
links
up
the
real
and
the
virtual
world
as
people
gain
knowledge
from
internet
and
apply
it
to
the
everyday
life
.

their
free
time
can
be
better
spent
in
a
quality
and
meaningful
way
.

however
,
-
funding
of
training
programmes
should
still
proceed
as
it
would
increase
the
productivity
and
capability
of
the
working
population
in
handling
any
challenges
there
might
surface
in
the
future
.

first
,
it
takes
up
too
much
more
space
for
its
lightweight
.

the
fundamental
problem
is
because
the
states
fail
to
realize
the
social
problems
behind
,
which
contributed
to
the
stressful
ageing
process
.

individuals
'
parents
will
not
want
to
go
for
genetic
testing
as
they
feel
that
if
one
of
them
has
a
positive
test
result
,
they
are
the
one
who
passed
their
mutated
genes
to
individuals
.

this
is
due
to
the
better
inculcation
and
cultivation
of
morale
values
among
the
youth
as
a
result
of
better
education
system
,
thus
increasing
their
responsibility
in
taking
care
of
their
immediate
elderly
family
members
.

engineering
would
have
to
use
the
engineering
design
processes
to
list
out
multiple
solutions
the
designing
of
product
(
khandani
,
s.
(
2005
)
)
.

thirdly
,
it
provides
us
a
lot
of
convenience
because
as
a
result
-
of
the
widespread
of
this
technology
,
some
old
and
needy
patients
can
be
cared
and
thus
under
safe
condition
anywhere
.

in
this
final
stage
,
it
is
all
about
how
packaging
,
marketing
and
distribution
of
the
products
.

genetic
testing
creates
tension
within
a
family
because
it
conveys
people
the
information
of
getting
ill
-
also
implies
other
family
members
the
possibility
of
having
the
same
defect
genes
(
kahn,2000
)
.

in
the
current
situation
,
it
is
best
to
reflect
on
the
funds
provided
and
given
to
the
elderly
in
near
future
.

technological
innovations
created
from
scientific
researching
are
created
to
satisfy
a
need
of
to
solve
a
problem
affecting
people
.

the
normal
methods
like
injecting
medicine
,
predicting
a
threat
origin
using
common
equipment
do
not
bring
optimized
results
or
worse
,
it
is
useless
especially
with
the
dangerous
diseases
.

they
hope
to
develop
lenses
such
that
they
will
allow
players
to
be
entirely
immersed
in
the
game
allowing
them
to
move
without
any
constraints
.

apart
from
this
,
some
other
singaporeans
might
not
think
that
later
retirement
is
a
good
idea
.

moreover
,
-
amount
of
government
incentive
,
for
example
-
central
providence
fund
board
(
cpf
)
in
singapore
will
be
enough
for
them
to
live
independently
after
the
retirement
if
they
longer
their
working
life
.

however
,
as
singapore
has
limited
land
,
we
can
not
go
on
forever
creating
water
catchment
area
from
our
land
.

in
addition
,
more
ramps
and
slopes
are
to
be
built
to
ensure
the
mobility
of
wheelchair
bound
elderly
and
also
the
physically
disabled
.

being
equipped
with
this
self
sufficient
form
of
energy
,
mankind
can
then
continue
to
come
up
with
cutting
edge
technology
without
the
fear
of
harming
our
planet
.

therefore
,
public
spending
is
needed
to
bring
the
children
out
of
the
vicious
circle
.

also
the
coolant
of
-
scwr
is
water
which
is
cheaper
compared
with
-
other
kinds
of
reactors
.

with
economic
growth
,
the
budget
available
will
increase
and
we
can
afford
to
spend
the
same
portion
of
the
budget
yet
providing
a
larger
real
sum
.

the
introduction
of
new
technologies
and
treatments
for
the
aged
are
relatively
expensive
.

economist
[
2006
]
specified
that
previously
the
retirement
age
was
70
in
a
certain
country
;
however
,
it
changed
to
65
years
old
.

hence
-
vhtrs
are
,
to
an
extent
,
better
than
lfrs
.

however
,
the
msr
uses
fluoride
salt
,
which
is
more
corrosive
and
high
temperature
.

it
is
the
study
of
how
characteristics
are
passed
down
through
generations
.

the
public
often
have
doubts
when
it
leads
to
security
and
safety
issues
on

.

universal

(

.

some
people
may
have
doubts
about
the
productivity
of
elder
people
and
argue
that
it
is
elder
people
's
right
to
lead
later
lives
of
ease
.

in
conclusion
,
the
use
of
rfid
to
track
people
should
be
banned
,
not
only
because
it
violates
an
individual
's
privacy
but
-
it
could
also
encourage
more
potential
criminals
to
commit
atrocities
and
to
stir
up
the
greed
within
businessmen
.

it
allows
one
to
know
if
he
has
a
genetic
disorder
by
doing
the
test
.

gif
is
researching
them
in
terms
of
their
safety
factor
,
their
cost
factor
and
their
effect
to
the
environment
because
these
are
the
public
-
concern
about
them
.

public
spending
will
be
required
and
should
not
be
limited
for
modifications
works
-
such
as
lift
upgrading
projects
that
enable
the
lift
to
stop
at
every
level
of
a
flat
.

it
may
be
costly
to
implement
these
policies
-
but
it
is
necessary
as
in
future
the
aging
population
is
projected
to
soar
.

the
details
in
-
implementation
should
all
be
made
clear
.

in
this
way
,
focusing
on
growing
the
country
's
economy
-
to
help
to
support
the
aged
seems
to
be
wise
.

besides
,
a
study
showed
last
year
by
a
group
of
scientist
and
economist
looked
at
the
potential
for
the
power
generated
by
nuclear
energy
to
triple
by
2050
.

molten-salt-reactor
technology
as
one
of
the
six
generation
iv
nuclear
reactors
are
designed
with
these
factors
in
mind
,
safe
,
environmentally
friendly
and
low
cost
electricity
,
however
with
all
the
different
concerns
involved
,
this
might
not
be
the
case
.

various
factors
have
contributed
to
allow
such
-
invention
to
be
widely
adopted
in
today
's
world
.

one
considerable
implication
of
-
aging
population
is
its
possible
impact
on
the
country
's
future
macro-economic
performance
(
schuiz
,
borowoki
,
&
crown
,
1991
)
.

surveillance
technology
has
a
history
dated
back
as
early
as
1965
,
where
the
first
closed
circuit
television
(
cctv
)
was
used
in
the
police
force
in
the
united
states
in
public
places
(
roberts
,
2005
)
.

therefore
,
such
unfavourable
factors
continue
to
place
the
elderly
in
need
of
the
public
support
for
their
health
care
.

from
the
all
the
reasons
mention
above
,
it
is
very
clear
that
cutting
down
public
spending
for
the
old
age
is
not
a
good
choice
in
order
to
divert
the
money
for
the
areas
of
development
.

indeed
,
the
utmost
purpose
for
the
existence
of
engineers
is
to
improve
the
living
standard
and
-
satisfy
the
higher
requirements
of
human
beings
by
creating
or
improving
the
products
used
in
daily
life
.

among
the
various
policies
introduced
to
allow
the
elderly
to
have
an
easier
time
aging
include
housing
,
employability
and
healthcare
which
will
help
to
ease
their
ageing
process
.

the
'loss
'
of
the
company
of
their
loved
ones
may
be
difficult
for
them
to
accept
and
they
may
end
up
not
enjoying
the
rest
of
their
life
.

in
a
research
done
by
the
imperial
college
london
(
bbc,2008
)
,
``
the
results
showed
that
within
a

,
there
was
a
21

reduction
in

and

''

in
conclusion
,
through
the
various
available
health
polices
,
government
policies
,
social
policies
and
technological
advancements
,
the
elderly
now
is
able
to
lead
a
better
more
comfortable
and
more
fulfilling
life
.

and
if
this
problem
persists
,
it
will
gradually
become
a
roadblock
for
the
future
advancement
of
a
society
.

therefore
,
i
conclude
that
although
current
research
and
development/policies
have
helped
to
ease
the
aging
process
to
a
large
extent
,
but
they
have
not
managed
to
fully
solve
the
problem
.

applications
such
as
the
baycreast
's
memory-link
program
that
can
be
installed
on
a
pda
have
functions
to
set
time-based
alerts
and
snapped
photos
to
aid
the
elderly
in
remembering
important
details
.

all
the
boffins
are
required
to
attain
some
academic
objections
per
year
.

this
shows
that
an
elderly
-
is
never
a
useless
person
in
the
society
.

self-employed
people
do
not
have
cpf
as
they
are
not
working
under
any
employers
,
so
the
employees
and
employers
do
not
contribute
part
of
the
employees
'
salary
to
the
cpf
.

although
numerous
news
claims
that
ev
is
unsafe
,
there
are
evidences
of
improvements
have
been
made
to
make
ev
safe
to
drive
.

moreover
,
the
processed
heat
that
the
nuclear
reactor
produces
can
also
be
used
in
other
industrial
areas
such
as
hydrogen
production
,
water
desalination
and
the
treatment
crude
oil
(

.

personal
privacy
is
our
very
own
right
.

aging
with
grace
,
are
ones
with
good
health
and
lifestyles
,
financial
stability
and
coupled
with
company
of
family
and
friends
.

people
often
mention
that
singapore
only
have
got
human
resource
.

thus
,
one
of
the
campaigns
organized
by
the
united
kingdom
is
to
end
the
discrimination
faced
by
the
aged
.

and
from
the
third
stage
onward
,
the
post-it
notes
and
the
super
glue
finally
share
the
similarity
.

(

according
to
-
us
national
institute
of
health
,
genetic
testing
is
the
examination
of
a
person
's
dna
taken
from
cells
in
his
or
her
blood
,
tissues
or
other
body
fluids
that
exhibit
a
disease
or
disorder
(
dr.
richard
k.
)
.

with
the
qualified
security
system
developed
,
the
nuclear
terrorism
can
be
prevented
.

this
shows
that
implanting
chips
in
human
may
cause
cancer
.

in
this
situation
,
nuclear
power
deserves
the
research
funding
for
further
-
development
.

firstly
,
the
opponents
question
the
safe
operation
of
the
vhtr
-
over
1000
celsius
degree
under
transient
condition
.

thus
,
a
country
's
budget
can
not
be
adjusted
without
much
consideration
and
thought
or
else
it
can
cause
instabilities
to
the
supporting
pillars
of
a
country
.

iconic
infrastructure
developments
would
be
the
building
of
-
integrated
resort
(
ir
)
and
casino
that
are
aimed
to
attract
foreign
investment
and
tourist
attraction
.

another
difference
is
that
acceptance
of
the
technology
initially
by
the
public
.

however
,
with
strong
effort
,
many
things
can
be
done
to
help
our
elderly
.

it
has
made
his
life
after
retirement
one
of
relaxation
,
with
comforts
close
at
hand
,
always
.

that
is
why
it
is
hard
to
make
prediction
in
future
numbers
of
blind
because
of
unknown
quantity
in
population
growth
.

medical
professionals
contend
that
these
family
members
may
experience
psychological
effects
such
as
fear
,
anxiety
and
depression
,
affecting
their
lifestyle
(
yap
,
2005
)
.

for
example
,
it
can
not
only
look
up
words
in
chinese
and
english
as
the
old
one
does
,
but
also
many
other
languages
,
like
japanese
and
franch
as
well
.

one
example
is
the
introduction
of
unmanned
combat
air
vehicles
by
the
engineers
in
the
military
.

as
a
consequence
,
a
huge
lost
was
caused
to
the
whole
industry
.

as
the
pace
of
society
quickens
,
people
around
the
world
are
faced
with
an
increasing
number
of
problems
.

it
should
be
evident
that
the
very-high-temperature
reactor
is
the
best
among
the
6
evolutionary
concepts
of
generation
4
reactors
.

however
,
the
use
of
rfid
can
have
undesirable
effects
on
our
body
because
radio
waves
from
rfid
are
mutagenic
and
it
is
harmful
when
exposed
in
large
quantity
.

as
the
saying
goes
``
prevention
is
better
than
cure
''
-
free
health
screening
and
health
campaigns
should
be
implemented
-
.

from
primary
schools
to
junior
colleges
,
lecturers
are
always
rushing
through
lessons
in
order
to
be
able
to
finish
the
syllabus
on
time
.

as
such
,
it
is
logical
that
we
support
the
research
of
swcr
.

for
example
,
there
are
customized
to
contain
various
elderly
friendly
features
such
as
the
alarm
system
that
automatically
request
for
help
through
a
pull
of
a
lever
in
case
of
-
emergency
.

singapore
is
currently
a
develop
country
.

to
conclude
,
although
some
technical
issues
of
-
super
critical
water
reactor
are
still
under
researching
,
personally
i
reckon
that
the
scwr
would
be
the
most
promising
reactor
against
other
generation
-
ones
,
in
terms
of
performance
,
cost
,
feasibility
,
and
impacts
to
the
environment
.

one
of
the
many
reasons
given
to
support
the
claim
for
scwr
funding
is
that
-
scwr
is
the
combination
of
two
proven
technologies
-
which
are
light
water
moderated
reactors
(
lwrs
)
and
supercritical-water
fossil
plants
(
buoniorno
,
2002
)
.

since
there
are
foundations
for
the
benefit
of
the
hearing
impaired
,
one
step
that
could
be
taken
is
to
unite
these
institutes
with
the
developers
of
this
technology
-
to
make
ensure
the
research
continues
.

after
which
they
will
be
treated
and
purified
by
various
sub-processes
such
as
reverse
osmosis
,
distillation
,
chemical
disinfection
and
some
others
.

in
addition
,
this
technology
also
complements
the
work
of
security
personnel
and
thus
provides
added
protection
against
sneaky
terrorist
attacks
.

firstly
,
some
older
workers
have
weak
command
of
english
or
are
english
illiterate
as
they
are
school
dropouts
.

workers
can
still
have
medical
check
regularly
to
ensure
they
are
healthy
as
health
problems
would
n't
come
in
a
sudden
,
it
must
accumulate
over
time
.

funding
and
incentives
were
given
to
companies
to
improve
automobile
technology
as
whichever
countries
with
the
more
advance
technologies
have
a
higher
chance
of
winning
the
war
.

the
most
doubtful
question
still
appears
in
public
is
about
the
safety
design
as
well
as
security
solution
to
against
any
attempt
of
terrorists
or
saboteurs
.

to
summarize
,
government
encourage
later
retirement
in
order
to
reduce
elderly
dependency
and
implement
social
policy
such
as
subsidy
on
housing
medical
fee
.

second
,
although
the
land
required
to
build
the
scwr
is
less
than
-
the
existing
reactors
,
the
area
needed
to
build
-
new
scwr
would
be
better
utilized
as
area
for
agriculture
-
especially
in
the
future
.

they
realize
the
first
problem
comes
up
now
is
-
we
need
a
revolution
in
medical
procedures
.

finally
is
the
entrepreneurship
process
where
innovations
are
punch
into
the
new
market
.

however
,
if
this
trend
of
spending
has
been
continuing
in
the
future
time
,
it
will
be
destructive
to
a
country
's
financial
structure
.

with
-
elderly
returning
to
the
workforce
,
they
are
less
dependent
on
the
government
subsidies
and
thus
,
less
funds
should
be
set
aside
for
the
elderly
.

the
possibilities
are
endless
,
but
it
proves
one
point
.

it
will
be
burdensome
to
china
's
next
generation
,
especially
the
tax
payers
,
-
if
the
expenditures
on
medical
and
welfare
programs
are
not
held
in
check
.

however
,
science
daily
(
2008
)
notes
that
genetic
information
nondiscrimination
act
(
gina
)
has
been
approved
to
forbid
-
insurance
company
from
discriminating
through
reduced
coverage
or
pricing
and
prohibits
employer
from
making
adverse
employment
decision
in
order
to
encourage
more
people
to
undergo
genetic
test
-
which
could
save
lives
in
the
long
run
.

helium
will
not
become
radioactive
and
will
not
react
with
other
materials
.

in
conclusion
,
sfr
stands
as
a
more
viable
option
to
be
the
solution
to
the
world
's
energy
crisis
.

so
for
the
country
's
development
-
there
should
be
more
injections
than
the
leakages
.

this
satisfy
the
need
as
electricity
can
be
generated
from
renewable
sources
of
energies
like
solar
and
wind
energy
.

-
workfare
scheme
is
also
been
implemented
recently
to
cater
to
the
aging
process
,
especially
for
-
elderly
who
are
less
educated
that
results
in
low-income
level
.

another
example
about
public
spending
on
medical
subsidies
for
the
aged
is
the
elderly
,
who
represented
about
7
per
cent
of
the
south
korean
population
,
accounted
for
17.7
per
cent
of
total
national
health
insurance
(
nhi
)
expenditures
in
2001
(
yoon
and
hendricks
,
2006
)
.

they
say
that
related
department
have
to
spend
too
much
money
on
the
plants
and
the
revenue
can
not
cover
the
cost
.

in
countries
such
as
united
kingdom
,
welfare
system
and
pension
scheme
are
in
place
.

social
work
aims
at
restructuring
the
society
,
such
that
a
more
balanced
society
is
attained
,
where
no
single
citizen
becomes
the
victim
of
the
economics
development
.

we
can
conclude
that
sfr
is
also
cost
saving
.

the
current
generation
of
elderly
is
most
probably
the
first
batch
to
learn
about
the
cpf
in
1955
,
and
being
a
young
scheme
then
,
there
is
a
high
chance
that
they
-
unable
to
fully
benefit
from
it
.

on
the
other
hand
,
it
is
fortunate
that
the
singapore
central
provident
fund
(
cpf
)
,
which
is
the
fundamental
pillar
of
our
social
security
framework
for
the
old-aged
,
lend
itself
readily
to
provide
citizens
for
the
needs
of
aging
population
.

the
senior
activity
centre
also
provides
a
place
for
the
lonely
old
folks
to
mingle
around
and
to
participate
in
recreational
activity
.

the
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
so
that
the
money
can
be
diverted
to
other
sectors
of
the
country
's
development
-
like
public
transportation
or
the
army
.

but
,
the
aging
problem
may
be
exaggerated
,
due
to
a
variety
of
reasons
.

it
is
now
widespread
and
ranging
from
testing
the
congenital
defect
of
a
foetus
to
finding
the
existence
of
the
oncogene
.

there
were
no
occupational
hazard
influenced
by
the
decisiveness
and
attitude
of
the
project
managers
.

therefore
,
innovations
that
were
created
in
a
skunkwork
environment
are
usually
created
faster
than
those
inventions
created
by
conventional
research
.

for
example
,
on
july
2007
,
c3m
and
local
university
,
uni
sim
offered
courses
to
senior
citizens
so
as
to
enable
them
to
earn
credits
through
courses
and
pursue
a
degree
in
future
.

critics
also
argue
over
efficiency
problems
of
the
vhtr
.

in
some
sense
,
innovation
helps
humankind
to
move
forward
.

this
is
vital
as
the
speed
at
which
information
is
communicated
can
determine
if
the
mission
will
succeed
.

although
there
are
regulations
to
prevent
insurers
from
discriminating
people
with
a
higher
chance
of
getting
certain
genetic
diseases
-
the
changes
in
health
care
financing
and
organization
(
hcfo
)
,
2005
)
,
it
might
lead
to
higher
insurance
premium
for
everyone
.

hard
work
finally
pays
off
.

global
warming
has
been
linked
to
the
more
frequent
occurrence
of
natural
disasters
.

overall
,
the
governments
have
done
well
in
helped
to
ease
-
aging
process
in
a
large
extent
with
the
above
policies
.

it
was
mentioned
by
associate
professor
paulin
straugha
,
national
university
of
singapore
in
the
article
that
one
hospitalization
trip
could
cost
tens
of
thousands
of
money
,
where
is
the
younger
generation
going
to
get
the
money
from
?

while
not
compromising
the
benefits
it
brings
,
the
ethical
and
moral
issues
regarding
surveillance
technology
far
outweighs
the
benefits
it
bring
.

thus
,
to
deal
with
such
challenges
,
researches
-
and
developments
or
policies
have
been
brought
out
to
help
the
elderly
.

hence
the
total
time
consumed
is
much
shorter
-
compared
to
the
technology
develop
through
research
.

these
micro-robot
can
have
many
useful
functions
.

many
useful
feed
back
is
needed
in
order
for
more
problems
to
be
identified
.

even
though
conventionally
generated
technology
is
more
popular
nowadays
,
both
ways
of
production
have
its
own
advantages
and
disadvantages
.

the
rights
and
wrongs
on
using
surveillance
technology
on
the
public
has
been
an
issue
for
a
long
time
.

all
these
are
called
genetic
discrimination
.

since
the
lead
user
has
such
a
great
need
on
a
product
that
could
help
them
keep
the
food
cool
easily
,
-
refrigerator
was
first
commercially
introduced
to
long
distance
food
transportation
in
1900s
(
bowden
&
offer
,
1994
)
.

consequently
,
-
public
claims
that
nuclear
power
wastes
create
a
high
degree
of
proliferation
risks
and
until
today
there
is
no
solution
on
it
.

this
effort
should
be
continued
without
fail
as
this
would
guarantee
the
living
standard
of
the
old
aged
.

firstly
,
with
the
aid
of
technology
,
senior
citizens
can
have
more
mobility
to
go
wherever
they
like
under
a
safer
condition
.

we
are
compelled
to
sacrifice
some
to
counter
them
;
otherwise
we
lose
-
more
.

this
aid
enables
medical
treatment
to
be
more
affordable
.

in
fact
,
the
vhtr
could
even
produce
50
%
more
electricity
from
the
-
same
amount
of
fuel
compared
with
other
nuclear
plants
.

in
general
,
three
aspects
can
be
innovated
:
they
are
improving
the
effectiveness
of
energy
use
and
production
,
designing
methods
to
store
and
accumulate
small
portions
of
energy
,
and
finding
cleaner
and
renewable
energy
resources
.

another
factor
that
also
deteriorates
the
creativity
is
-
natural
resources
,
as
known
as
the
space
,
time
,
materials
...
for
designing
.

there
must
be
some
reasons
.

many
developed
countries
are
starting
to
express
interests
in
this
new
nuclear
technology
and
some
even
form
a
consortium
to
pool
their
expertise
and
funding
to
-
research
on
the
six
most
promising
prospects
for
the
future
gen
iv
reactors
.

former
president
of
america
regan
even
state
the
announcement
of
-
star
war
program
,
although
it
was
given
up
at
the
end
.

supporters
of
lfr
claim
that
lfr
is
much
safer
than
vhtr
.

nowadays
electronic
information
from
consumers
is
``
collected
,
compiled
and
sold
''
(
consumer
watchdog
,
2009
)
without
reasonable
safeguards
and
therefore
poses
a
threat
to
the
exposure
of
private
matters
of
consumers
that
may
lead
to
abuse
of
such
information
for
certain
benefits
or
intentions
.

hence
,
this
-
caused
singaporeans
who
were
not
as
proficient
to
become
unemployed
.

during
newater
's
history
,
-
government
,
-
resources
and
the
development
of
other
technology
show
a
significant
influence
on
the
development
of
newater
.

hence
,
they
will
rely
heavily
on
the
government
subsidies
.

(
ministry
of
communication
development
,
youth
and
sports
[
mycs
]
,
2001
)
-
policies
were
introduced
,
implemented
,
refined
,
retuned
,
relooked
,
re-discussed
and
re-implemented
with
the
goal
of
minimizing
the
impact
of
the
problems
associated
with
an
ageing
population
.

after
conducting
a
root
cause
analysis
on
the
accident
,
a
psychologist
could
perhaps
aid
the
company
by
vetting
the
flawed
regulations
to
grant
train
conductors
the
power
to
make
an
assessment
to
stop
the
train
should
he
receive
any
complaints
from
passengers
.

apart
from
the
demands
from
business
and
education
,
other
factors
have
also
shaped
the
development
of
virtual
technology
and
solutions
have
been
designed
to
meet
the
needs
.

according
to
butler
,
the
global
demand
for
energy
is
expected
to
double
by
2050
(
nature,2004
)
.

there
are
a
group
of
people
who
might
strongly
feel
that
if
proper
research
had
been
done
,
the
engineers
-
would
have
come
up
with
a
better
design
such
that
any
faulty
in
the
wheels
would
have
-
detected
and
hence
preventing
the
train
from
moving
.

(
lee,2009
)
.this
is
done
when
singaporeans
reach
the
age
of
55
,
part
of
their
cpf
savings
will
be
transferred
into
an
annuity
which
will
provide
a
steady
stream
of
income
from
the
age
of
65
for
life.cpf
is
a
mandatory
saving
scheme
and
therefore
it
ensures
that
the
elderly
will
have
the
financial
means
to
support
their
aging
process
.

however
in
some
cases
where
unfilial
children
comes
in
,
the
government
has
introduced
the
``
parents
maintenance
act
law
''
,
to
help
solve
the
problem
of
unfilial
children
by
making
them
support
their
elderly
parents
in
a
form
of
paying
them
a
monthly
allowance
.

in
the
society
,
there
is
still
a
fraction
who
remain
jobless
or
whose
job
do
not
have
a
steady
contribution
to
the
cpf
.

by
the
same
time
,
the
online
banking
system
also
facilitates
the
procedure
to
make
deals
.

however
,
these
problems
could
be
solved
by
the
new
generation
iv
reactors
.

cpf
life
was
launched
this
month
to
provide
singaporeans
a
lifelong
income
into
old
age
.

chinese
talents
are
spreading
all
over
the
world
.

however
,
with
efforts
to
reform
-
education
,
i
optimistically
believe
that
we
can
overcome
these
obstacles
to
be
competitive
engineers
in
-
global
market
.

in
contrast
,
penicillin
is
a
serendipitous
discovery
.

hence
,
it
is
not
ethically
wrong
to
inform
relatives
of
the
carrier
about
the
possible
risk
and
the
decision
to
whether
they
should
undergo
similar
genetic
testing
would
then
be
up
to
them
.

increasing
the
awareness
of
filial
obligation
will
result
in
more
adult
children
living
-
and
taking
care
of
their
elder
parents
.

the
convenience
and
problems
this
technology
brings
to
us
make
it
hard
for
us
to
decide
whether
it
should
be
legal
to
track
people
making
use
of
it
.

this
strategy
calls
for
having
private
clinics
to
-
be
within
a
hundred
metres
from
the
homes
.

in
the
current
world
people
depend
more
and
more
on
technology
to
improve
their
life
,
which
stimulus
the
development
of
science
and
technology
in
reverse
.

an
individual
who
only
has
one
altered
copy
of
a
gene
is
known
as
a
carrier
.

in
view
of
an
aging
population
,
the
government
knew
that
healthcare
is
one
major
sector
that
they
can
not
neglect
.

)
population
and
demography
key
indicator
2008

the
government
came
up
with
the
maintenance
of
parents
act
in
the
1996
and
has
been
studying
to
best
use
this
legal
pressure
to
ensure
that
the
children
will
take
care
of
their
parents
as
filial
obligations
would
reduce
the
reliance
of
the
elderly
on
the
government
,
therefore
,
the
government
's
budget
on
the
elderly
need
not
be
as
huge
.

hence
,
there
is
a
worry
that
the
government
will
neglect
the
subsidies
to
other
important
sectors
,
such
as
education
and
defence.however
,
people
should
not
worry
about
this
because
increasing
subsidies
for
elderly
can
increase
the
new
opportunity
for
the
young
generation
.

thus
,
the
responsibility
of
the
younger
generation
can
be
greatly
reduced
from
decrease
need
of
caretakers
and
medical
costs
.

this
is
because
molten
salt
reactor
has
different
safety
approaches
which
can
prevent
the
meltdown
.

a
large
amount
of
the
expenditure
used
is
contributed
by
government
taxation
on
the
working
citizens
.

calories
restricted
diets
can
induce
a
slowdown
of
the
aging
process
and
showing
increased
survival
,
resistance
to
diseases
,
prevent
brain
deterioration
and
lastly
on
less
muscle
loss
.

signboards
that
are
in
-
area
of
traffic
congestion
and
other
possible
affected
areas
would
be
updated
and
give
suggestion
to
the
drivers
to
redirect
them
away
from
the
traffic
congestion
.

to
improve
the
solar
heating
system
,
engineers
add
accessorial
energy
equipment
to
it
such
as
electrical
heater
.

being
aware
of
it
,
they
may
choose
to
go
through
some
genetic
tests
to
check
whether
the
disorder
presents
(
scientific
american
,
2008
)
.

although
it
would
take
years
to
develop
such
advanced
technology
and
probably
spend
quite
a
large
sum
of
money
,
researches
and
studies
have
to
be
done
to
tackle
the
faster
mounting
nuclear
waste
problem
.

so
they
think
it
is
not
deserved
.

the
amount
of
subsidy
on
hospitalization
will
be
determined
by
-
means-testing
.

in
effect
,
more
productive
children
will
be
raised
and
there
will
be
sufficient
numbers
of
younger
generations
to
replace
those
of
the
older
generations
as
they
retire
.

cruelty
leads
to
insensitivity
towards
death
and
violence
,
which
links
to
-
crime
rates
.

i
will
further
elaborate
on
my
stand
based
on
the
above
two
aspects
.

for
instance
,
the
government
should
spend
part
of
the
national
budget
in
trying
to
increase
the
fertility
rate
.

they
need
to
recognize
that
the
effectiveness
of
any
strategies
will
depend
on
every
individual
involvement
.

moreover
,
the
ever
increasing
risk
of
terrorism
will
result
in
a
much
threatening
situation
if
-
nuclear
weapon
is
been
stolen
.

one
example
would
be
designing
a
fridge
that
uses
less
power
to
run
.

obviously
,
to
lessen
the
world
's
thirst
of
energy
in
the
long
term
,
and
to
reduce
the
growing
number
of
disasters
,
i
am
in
favor
of
using
nuclear
power
as
a
main
resource
of
energy
in
the
future
.

likewise
,
in
singapore
,
the
government
spends
s
$
110
million
to
pay
basic
medishield
premiums
for
two
years
for
singaporeans
aged
61
to
69
so
that
90
%
of
the
elder
can
have
health
care
benefits
(
cited
in
asian
metacare
paper
)
.

one
of
the
examples
of
-
medical
system
is
``
posture
monitoring
system
''
which
can
monitor
body
-
posture
all
the
time
and
keep
warning
the
user
to
maintain
best
posture
.

differences
like
,
risks
involved
,
working
environments
,
marketing
strategies
while
similarities
like
the
visions
and
goals
of
both
innovations
.

compared
with
the
human
ligaments
,
the
lars
ligament
is
much
more
tensile
.

thus
they
are
the
reasons
why
local
singaporean
engineers
have
failed
to
come
out
with
a
stunning
innovation
yet
.

they
eventually
build
its
first
plant
after
the
technology
of
dual
membrane
purification
has
matured
and
the
production
cost
has
come
down
.

however
,
that
is
not
true
.

jack
d.
gillum
and
associates
did
not
calculate
the
alternate
plan
before
they
assigned
on
the
paper
.

economically
,
because
the
model
t
was
so
cheap
that
by
the
1920s
a
majority
of
american
drivers
learned
to
drive
on
the
model
t.
apart
from
this
,
in
order
to
make
the
model
t
more
universal
,
henry
ford
also
created
a
massive
publicity
machine
in
detroit
to
ensure
every
newspaper
carried
stories
and
ads
about
the
new
product
.

in
today
's
context
,
-
graying
population
has
become
an
arising
problem
in
many
societies
.

moreover
,
this
country
's
monetary
is
not
in
a
proper
condition
;
indeed
-
global
crisis
makes
it
even
worse
.

public
funds
can
be
gathered
through
-
taxes
on
the
citizens
and
also
tariffs
on
incoming
trade
items
from
other
countries
.

including
psychological
factors
consideration
during
the
design
process
is
found
to
be
one
of
the
ways
to
improve
safety
which
might
have
prevented
the
chernobyl
incident
.

as
illustrated
,
there
exist
many
current
social
policies
which
have
become
widely
available
.

the
decrease
itself
can
be
caused
by
2
different
things
:
low
birth
rate
-
which
means
the
problem
arises
because
the
shortage
of
youth
-
and
low
education
-
which
means
that
the
problem
arises
because
-
the
shortage
of
well-educated
youths
for
the
workforce
.

these
are
the
practical
summaries
of
the
science
researches
and
discoveries
.

where
should
the
limit
of
the
public
spending
on
the
aged
be
drawn
at
,
if
it
should
be
limited
?

the
impact

generated

to
change

fate
of

.

in
addition
,
the
opinion
of
world
health
organization
(
2009
)
is
that
choosing
not
to
inform
is
a
well-intentioned
decision
which
do
not
to
add
extra
problems
and
unduly
distress
to
others
.

he
mentioned
that
though
singapore
is
on
the
way
of
new
hospitals
and
strategies
of
saving
cost
in
the
recovery
of
the
economical
downturn
,
the
community
themselves
should
be
obliged
to
maintain
a
healthy
lifestyle
(

)
.

pollution
is
a
growing
concern
to
the
environment
,
-
``
small

area
of
the
central
business
district
led
to
severe
traffic
conditions
including
congestion
,
reduced
traffic
speeds
,
and
environmental
problems
.
''

by
encouraging
re-
employment
,
the
government
is
assisting
the
elderly
to
lead
an
active
and
productive
life
.

on
the
contrary
,
some
singaporeans
have
the
mind
set
that
these
services
and
programmes
are
not
of
utmost
importance
to
them
as
they
each
have
their
own
medisave
account
to
pay
for
their
hospitalization
bills
.

also
,
-
tourism
sector
have
made
huge
contributions
to
singapore
's
economy
,
with
an
estimated
$
230
billion
in
2007
.

it
would
give
a
great
contentment
if
the
product
is
fully
used
and
-
able
to
save
human
life
.

first
,
modern
medicine
is
now
able
to
cure
or
treat
many
diseases
that
were
once
terminal
.

in
addition
,
-
abundant
heat
produced
in
the
vhtr
system
raises
the
efficiency
of
hydrogen
gas
production
to
a
significant
level
.

by
reaching
the
age
of
55
,
they
are
allowed
to
withdraw
their
cpf
funds
and
use
them
for
retirement
.

on
the
other
hand
,
proponents
can
argue
that
life
should
not
be
gambled
with
and
especially
when
it
involves
with
the
loved
ones
.

generation
iii
reactors
are
built
within
a
double
concealment
which
will
protect
the
reactor
even
the
outer
layer
is
penetrated
.

at
this
point
,
one
may
wonder
that
the
old
people
did
contribute
to
the
improvements
of
their
countries
in
the
past
,
consequently
,
they
deserve
the
government
's
regard
at
their
old
age
and
if
the
governments
ignore
this
problem
,
the
next
generations
may
not
be
willing
to
devote
their
ability
to
those
who
will
make
their
contributions
oblivious
.

apart
from
safety
issue
,
in
order
to
implement
the
very
high
temperature
reactor
,
people
also
concern
about
the
economic
factor
.

this
essay
will
discuss
on
the
limit
that
should
be
imposed
to
the
amount
of
funds
that
should
be
budgeted
for
spending
on
the
aged
that
would
constitute
as
a
fair
distribution
of
government
resources
.

apart
from
these
schemes
,
singapore
is
also
trying
hard
to
create
an
elderly-friendly
environment
for
instance
,
lifts
were
modified
to
stop
on
every
floor
,
using
non-slip
floor
tile
to
minimize
the
danger
of
elderly
-
being
slipped
and
fell
,
having
support
hand
bar
in
toilet
,
alert
alarm
system
,
building
of
ramps
and
link
ways
to
facilitate
wheelchair
access
,
and
a
lot
more
.

it
is
in
the
government
's
interest
that
these
elderly
do
receive
an
appropriate
amount
of
attention
and
care
so
that
they
will
not
be
deprived
of
company
at
old
age
.

then
,
we
can
use
energy
that
is
safe
,
abundant
,
reliable
,
inexpensive
and
yet
proliferation
resistant
(
butler
,
2004
)
.

billions
of
dollars
is
taking
place
in
building
a
nuclear
reactor
and
not
-
a
few
million
.

furthermore
,
they
have
been
providing
voluntary
services
by
actively
involving
themselves
in
community
organisations
(
australian
institute
of
health
and
welfare,2007
)
.

in
this
forum
,
the
young
generation
is
expected
to
spend
more
time
and
be
more
understanding
towards
the
elderly.the
government
also
encourage
the
elderly
to
run
a
healhty
lifesyle
,
such
as
not
smoking
,
consuming
a
healthy
diet
,
and
exercising
regularly
.

for
example
,
like
the
surveillance
camera
,
peeping
toms
and
other
criminals
commonly
use
them
for
crimes
,
yet
why
does
the
government
still
allow
such
technology
to
be
used
.

critics
of
this
position
point
out
their
concerns
over
the
misuse
of
the
funds
once
it
is
-
made
available
.

this
determines
how
accurate
the
engineer
might
have
been
in
his
work
and
also
if
he
-
looked
at
nature
as
a
considerable
factor
during
his
designing
process
.

there
is
an
invisible
link
.

thus
,
a
serendipitous
technology
can
be
seen
as
a
conventional
technology
-
with
less
research
.

the
issue
of
how
to
attract
consumers
is
none
business
with
engineers
.

mobile
phones
,
bicycles
and
electric
appliances
are
the
examples
of
the
application
of
the
technological
creativity
.

the
elderly
have
to
be
convinced
to
adopting
of
a
healthy
and
balanced
lifestyle
.

moreover
,
the
opponents
misunderstood
the
distribution
of
electric
power
generation
.

critics
though
have
been
quick
to
identify
that
the
``
unauthorised
reading
and
changing
of
rfid
data
''
(
tan
and
li
2008
)
as
an
encroachment
of
privacy
.

moreover
,
the
rods
are
designed
with
graphite
tip
which
,
when
first
inserted
,
will
increases
the
reactivity
.

that
is
the
reason
why
we
always
have
to
improve
it
,
to
nurture
it
.

when
the
radioactive
waste
is
not
properly
stored
in
location
that
are
of
safe
distance
away
from
people
,
the
people
may
be
exposed
to
harmful
radiation
resulting
in
serious
health
effects
.

while
some
argue
that
the
adoption
of
rfid
is
a
violation
of
human
's
privacy
,
it
is
indeed
helps
to
protect
the
safety
of
family
and
-
public
and
-
identify
patients
.

from
the
trend
and
progress
of
nuclear
energy
,
i
can
predict
that
the
future
will
rely
very
much
on
nuclear
energy
to
power
the
world
.

therefore
,
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
to
an
acceptable
level
whereas
it
covers
the
neediest
that
are
desperate
for
help
,
while
most
of
the
other
portions
of
the
public
fund
should
be
invested
into
the
expansion
of
the
nation
to
generate
more
funds
for
the
aged
when
the
investments
ripen
.

in
the
area
of
psychology
,
the
effort
refers
to
the
individuals
'
and
society
's
values
,
perceptions
,
together
with
attitudes
of
ageing
and
the
elder
person
.

however
,
according
to
the
american
association
for
mental
retardation
aamr
[
3
]
,
revealing
of
genetic
testing
results
is
not
a
form
of
discrimination
but
it
is
to
be
fair
to
those
children
with
these
genetic
diseases
as
the
child
will
be
enrolled
into
the
school
that
provide
a
better
environment
for
them
to
study
in
.

for
example
,
lee
kuan
yew
,
minister
mentor
of
singapore
,
is
still
active
in
the
politic
by
advising
the
young
politicians
.

therefore
,
as
much
as
other
-
problems
,
mainly
those
dealing
with
the
economy
,
may
seem
to
demand
and
need
more
immediate
attention
,
the
ageing
population
issue
can
not
be
ignored
and
the
spending
on
this
area
should
not
be
reduced
in
order
for
majority
of
the
population
to
benefit
.

for
example
,
japan
's
atomic
energy
research
institute
based
in
kashiwa
has
already
operated
a
similar
reactor
as
the
vhtr
which
is
able
to
reach
a
record
high
temperature
of
950
degree
celsius
in
2004
.

being
covered
by
healthcare
insurance
has
become
critical
for
old
people
-
especially
those
with
disabilities
and
chronic
illness
associated
with
aging
.

instead
,
the
government
should
allow
its
public
spending
on
the
aged
to
hang
around
a
certain
percentage
.

the
findings
were
used
for
prevention
to
these
illness
,
thus
-
elderly
who
are
more
prone
to
these
diseases
are
able
to
take
more
precaution
to
their
health
.

by
maintaining
a
socially
active
lifestyle
,
-
elderly
are
more
resistance
to
health
problems
as
they
are
able
to
keep
both
their
mind
and
body
active
and
healthy
.

in
addition
,
the
efficiency
is
raised
effectively
due
to
the
high
temperature
,
which
accordingly
reduces
the
use
of
fuel
and
the
cost
of
complementary
equipment
by
50
%
or
more
.

the
reason
for
the
collapse
of
nicoll
highway
was
not
solely
due
to
-
mistake
in
the
design
.

this
is
different
from
scwr
-
which
uses
water
as
the
coolant
and
hence
there
is
a
possibility
of
-
pipe
's
corrosion
by
water
.

using
rfid
to
track
people
arises
many
issues
.

for
instance
,
-
central
provident
fund
(
cpf
)
,
a
comprehensive
financial
savings
plan
for
the
workers
-
has
been
implemented
in
singapore
.

cost
of
manufacture
including
materials
,
expertise
requirement
and
manpower
were
effectively
lessened
with
this
concept
.

in
the
1950s
,
the
soviet
union
tested
their
first
atomic
bomb
resulting
in
the
world
having
two
nuclear
super
powers
that
were
conflicting
with
each
other
over
world
political
dominance
and
military
superiority
.

investing
in
the
economic
growth
will
reduce
the
stress
of
the
younger
generation
as
more
jobs
will
be
provided
more
employment
with
higher
salary
will
be
available
to
the
working
adults
.

first
of
all
,
if
psychology
approaches
were
introduced
in
the
design
process
,
product
safety
could
be
better
guaranteed
.

therefore
if
the
engineers
of
-
titanic
were
prudent
in
the
engineering
design
process
,
they
would
have
included
a
high
margin
of
safety
factor
to
anticipate
possible
failure
during
the
construction
of
titanic
.

hence
,
the
government
is
then
able
to
divert
spending
to
the
national
growth
.

they
perceived
public
spending
on
the
aged
as
a
form
of
liability
to
a
country
because
such
spending
brings
no
future
benefits
to
the
country
,
and
-
cause
the
country
to
neglect
its
development
in
essential
areas
,
such
as
infrastructure
and
transport
facilities
,
which
serve
as
a
pulling
force
for
foreign
direct
investments
.

preparing
for
-
an
aging
population
:
the
singapore
experience
.

there
are
also
worries
over
leaked
confident
information
through
rfid
tags
.

although
such
may
argue
this
way
but
it
is
better
to
try
rather
than
to
leave
the
devastating
sickness
-
continue
to
haunt
out
-
older
generations
.

therefore
,
nuclear
power
actually
costs
about
the
same
as
coal
.

security
guards
and
camera
can
also
be
used
to
monitor
the
safety
operation
of
-
nuclear
power
plant
and
ensure
that
the
power
plant
is
free
from
terrorists
.

how
about
taking
account
of
psychology
?

in
considering
these
three
factors
,
i
feel
that
a
carrier
of
a
known
genetic
risk
is
obligated
to
reveal
the
results
to
his
or
her
relatives
.

public
spending
should
therefore
be
more
focus
on
providing
excellent
healthcare
facilities
and
services
which
would
benefits
and
eases
the
growing
health
crisis
amidst
the
aging
population
.

how
to
call
up
them
and
work
out
some
big
projects
is
a
tough
task
for
our
government
.

technological
innovations
can
range
from
household
appliances
to
industrial
equipment
.

housing
schemes
and
building
an
elderly-friendly
environment
would
definitely
make
the
elderly
to
live
more
comfortably
and
rewarding
.

once
these
researches
have
been
done
,
it
is
not
only
the
vhtr
system
will
benefit
,
but
also
many
other
industries
.

it
creates
-
modern
value
that
allows
people
of
opposite
sex
to
live
together
without
having
a
family
.

in
my
opinions
,
the
government
should
use
much
more
money
on
taking
care
of
elder
people
because
the
following
reason
:
firstly
,
the
aged
are
citizens
who
-
contributed
a
lot
of
money
to
-
national
treasury
through
compulsory
taxes
like
land-tax
,
income
tax
...
because
in
this
way
or
another
,
that
was
their
money
,
they
are
deserved
to
receive
more
care
from
the
authority
.

however
,
they
were
all
cleared
up
by
proper
guidance
and
much
effort
.

in
all
,
moving
beyond
-
law
to
enhance
the
perceptions
of
-
elderly
is
a
more
practical
way
to
increase
the
ability
and
willingness
of
the
society
to
coordinate
with
the
government
in
tackling
the
``
grey
tsunami
''
.

to
add
to
the
problems
stated
above
,
the
world
currently
needs
a
better
transport
,
in
terms
of
safety
and
functionalities
as
well
as
its
cost
.

in
addition
,
it
could
be
concluded
that
spending
money
-
on
economy
would
make
people
wealthy
,
which
could
greatly
help
to
ease
the
aging
problem
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
wastes
produced
by
the
nuclear
plants
are
highly
radioactive
and
can
not
be
easily
disposed
.

however
once
the
elderly
becomes
over
dependent
on
technology
,
they
will
be
at
a
loss
once
the
device
is
unable
to
respond
to
its
correct
state
.

in
order
to
gain
political
advantages
,
the
government
or
the
ruling
party
has
applied
plenty
of
policies
and
acts
to
constraint
the
freedom
of
individuals
in
giving
opinions
.

spending
on
the
old
does
not
denote
an
economic
dead
end
.

either
than
talents
,
providing
-
high
level
of
security
is
essential
.

i
disagree
against
the
idea
that
surveillance
technology
such
as
rfid
should
not
be
used
to
track
people
as
some
of
its
benefits
are
more
important
than
privacy
and
freedom
concerns
.

for
example
,
if
individuals
reveal
their
genetic
testing
results
to
their
parent
,
their
parents
will
feel
very
guilty
and
blame
themselves
as
individuals
had
inherited
their
mutated
gene
(
s
)
.

government
budgets
should
only
cater
on
-
basic
needs
of
-
elderly
.

consequently
,
a
disadvantageous
situation
is
created
instead
of
a
beneficial
one
.

generation
iv
nuclear
reactors
including
the
molten
salt
reactors
are
designed
to
be
safer
and
preventing
similar
incidents
-
as
the
chernobyl
and
three
mile
island
from
happening
again
.

however
,
the
days
when
people
use
more
electricity
than
they
produce
are
approaching
.

however
,
time
is
the
important
aspect
as
one
has
to
think
of
the
consequences
before
revealing
-
.

nuclear
power
which
is
generally
the
usage
of
nuclear
fission
reactions
to
obtain
electrical
energy
is
an
example

thus
,
it
is
the
environmental
factor
that
spurred

but
in
additional
,
a
pool
of
reserve
funds
should
be
available
to
cope
with
the
rising
aging
population
as
well
.

the
government
's
moral
obligation
should
not
be
supporting
the
elderly
only
.

countries
are
able
to
use

policy
of
encouraging

employment
,
increasing
the
awareness
of
filial
obligation
or
creating
new
development
of

to
the
elderly
in
their
country
.

had
estimated
that
more
than
2
billion
-
worldwide
will
contact

flu
(
scheirer
micheal

eben
.

through
cutting
down
some
spending
on
the
aged
,
the
funds
can
be
used
in
solving
problems
faced
by
society
and
help
to
relieve
the
pressure
faced
by
the
current
working
force
to
support
the
elderly
.

for
this
reason
that
the
aged
population
are
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
,
public
spending
can
be
limited
so
that
it
can
be
invested
to
other
areas
for
enhanced
development
.

example

the
faulty
design
of

precautions
in
place
,
will
definitely
serve
to
tackle
the
energy
problem
of
the
world
.

engineering
design
will
affect
the
development
in
malaysia
,
thus
government
should
to
pay
close
attention
to
this
issue
and
find
out
the
possible
solutions
.

in
conclusion
,
-
smallpox
vaccine
and
penicillin
are
tremendous
discoveries
that
save
numerous
people
's
lives
,
and
they
are
milestones
in
medicine
.

by
carefully
allocating
government
funds
,
the
society
will
benefit
as
a
whole
.

this
eco-car
has
no
fuel
tank
therefore
produce
no
emissions
at
all
.

although
there
are
public
opponents
who
do
not
wish
for
the
nuclear
reactors
to
be
built
due
to
potential
threats
,
past
incidences
and
cost
,
-
generation
iv
vhtr
aims
to
overcome
these
negative
aspects
with
funding
for
the
research
and
development
work
.

this
was
one
of
the
deadliest
singapore
's
civil
accidents
,
known
as
the
hotel
new
world
collapse
which
happened
on
15
march
1986
and
according
to
the
singapore
civil
defence
force
(
2009
)
,
this
misfortune
took
away
the
lives
of
33
.

seeking
third
parties
'
opinion
is
not
very
useful
as
they
might
not
fully
understand
the
situation
that
individuals
are
in
and
often
,
they
make
wrong
judgments
.

some
feel
that
the
incorporating
psychology
in
to
the
design
process
can
help
to
avoid
such
accidents
from
occurring
.

while
children
whose
parents
are
diagnosed
to
have
a
genetic
disease
can
very
possibly
to
have
it
(
genetic
home
reference
,
2009
)
,
they
should
be
inform
so
that
i
can
make
suitable
decision
in
choosing
job
,
participating
in
hard
activities
and
so
on
.

in
contrast
to
conventional
belief
,
edison
just
improved
upon
an
old
idea
which
had
been
thought
out
50
years
ago
.

therefore
,
their
balance
can
be
improved
and
-
lead
a
better
life
.

however
,
in
my
opinion
,
every
choice
we
made
definitely
has
an
opportunity
cost
which
means
something
has
to
be
given
up
in
order
to
attain
the
objective
we
want
.

hence
,
even
with
the
established
safety
regulations
in
engineering
,
the
practice
of
psychology
is
essential
in
re-examining
and
evaluating
the
design
products
for
hidden
dangers
to
prevent
disasters
.

among
all
kinds
of
nuclear
reactors
,
very-high-temperature
reactor
is
an
advanced
one
and
has
a
broad
prospect
.

secondly
,
elders
can
access
communication
network
through
specific
communication
devices
are
designed
for
elders
'
usage
.

secondly
,
some
people
may
think
that
nuclear
reaction
will
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
building
a
large
factory
and
using
the
high
technology
equipment
.

though
many
may
claim
that
the
bulk
of
the
amount
needed
to
support
the
aged
should
come
from
the
government
who
has
the
greatest
financial
power
in
supporting
them
,
however
,
this
public
spending
should
be
limited
.

however
-
there
are
six
new
generation
iv
reactors
being
developed
at
the
moment
that
promises
to
resolve
many
of
the
issues
posed
by
generators
of
the
past
.

firstly
,
vhtr
-
generates
energy
in
a
much
simpler
way
compared
to
other
types
of
reactors
.

in
the
article
-
the
generation
of
innovations
,
rogers
(
2003
)
stressed
that
the
engineering
design
process
for
innovation
including
``
problem
recognition
,
research
,
development
,
commercialization
,
diffusion
and
consequences
''
.

even
though
there
may
be
problems
and
public
opposition
along
the
way
,
but
by
bearing
in
mind
three
main
factors
namely
:
the
benefits
of
nuclear
energy
,
the
importance
of
a
strong
defence
and
most
importantly
,
the
importance
of
having
a
set
of
safety
protocols
,
we
are
able
to
push
the
development
of
nuclear
power
to
greater
heights
.

this
group
should
be
categorized
as
the
vulnerable
group
.

the
payoff
of
this
investment
is
a
highly
efficient
and
the
productive
workforce
.

however
,
not
every
elderly
in
the
society
can
get
to
enjoy
these
perks
,
especially
those
who
are
bounded
by
financial
problems
.

this
includes
desalination
and
damping
up
of
rivers
to
form
water
catchment
areas
.

moreover
,
computer
technology
and
network
technology
broaden
the
range
of
credit
card
's
service
and
make
a
strong
link
between
the
card
and
our
daily
life
.

but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
companies
do
save
up
a
lot
in
their
training
costs
as
these
employees
are
more
experienced
,
and
retaining
them
will
cut
down
on
the
recruitment
costs
.

last
but
not
least
,
-
the
price
of
an
ergonomical
design
should
be
reasonable
.

the
efforts
made
by
our
leaders
though
commendable
,
is
not
sufficient
to
ensure
the
elderly
interests
.

monitoring
employees
at
workplace
and
installing
video
cameras
at
public
places
such
as
banks
,
stores
or
restaurants
are
one
of
the
debatable
issues
today
.

longer
working
lives
also
meant
that
elders
would
continue
to
play
an
active
role
in
contributing
to
the
economy
and
society
,
thus
making
them
feeling
a
sense
of
fulfilment
.

this
can
be
achieve
by
emphasize
in
increasing
and
raising
more
productive
children
in
the
further
generation
as
mention
``
by
raising
more
productive
children
so
that
the
cost
burden
is
spread
over
a
larger
and
more
affluent
future
generation
''

-
a
long
time

this
will
alleviate
the
current
problem

what
is
more
,
people
may
be
reluctant
to
undergo
testing
for
that
they
can
not
decide
by
their
own
.

however
,
to
this
concern
,
many
nations

have
put
many

with

came
out
with

helped
to
ease

however
,
nuclear

there
is
more

hence

besides
that
,
the
rising
price
of

will
eventually
become
much
more
expensive
than
the
radioactive
materials
used
.

to
deal
with
such
challenges
,
research
and
development
as
well
as
-
implementation
of
policies
have
come
into
the
picture
.

for
example
,
in
the
singapore
national
service
,
the
professional
nature
of
the
military
officers
,
using
its
portion
of
dominant
influence
,
typically
make
most
of
the
important
decisions
about
innovation
.

according

,
medical

used
in

fortunately
,
a
new
subject
named
``
engineering
psychology
''
has
-
already
started
to
boom
recently
,
which
is
concerned
with
adapting
the
equipment
and
environment
to
people
,
based
upon
their
psychological
capacities
and
limitations
.

besides
-
social
impact
to
the
country
,
political
impact
will
be
another
factor
to
take
into
consideration
.

nevertheless
,
these
two
strategies
are
able
to
reduce
elder
dependency
.

however
,
the
country
's
modernization
should
be
prioritized
,
as
this
helps
to
improve
the
welfare
of
the
elderly
in
the
long
run
.

in
conclusion
,
rfid
usage
in
human
tracking
is
not
as
simple
and
beneficial
as
we
-
thought
of
.

for
example
,
in
singapore
,
people
begin
to
save
a
certain
percent
of
his
salary
into
his
bank
account
,
in
order
to
pay
the
housing
loan
,
car
loan
or
for
advanced
age
.

although
the
initial
clinical
outcomes
are
positive
,
safety
is
a
major
factor
why
the
robotic
surgical
system
still
remains
fearful
to
the
public
.

today
-
the
principal
challenges
are
using
green
resources
and
energy
to
get
a
radical
reduction
of
co2
emissions
to
deal
with
climate
change
and
to
pursue
sustainable
development
.

in
the
1980s
and
1990s
,
the
research
of
solar
energy
fell
into
the
low
tide
because
that
the
price
of
petroleum
fell
down
and
the
solar
energy
product
was
too
expensive
and
there
was
no
important
breakthrough
about
the
development
of
solar

.

only
after
that

the

-
began
to
pay
enough
attention
to
this
powerful
chemical
medicine
gradually
.

implementing
this
technology
properly
can
help
improve
security
in
working
places
.

in
conclusion
,
the
person
who
went
for
genetic
testing
should
have
the
final
say
on
whether
to
reveal
the
genetic
testing
result
so
that
he
will
not
be
discriminated
against
or
even
denied
of
his
basic
human
rights
-
and
causes
problems

as
the
vhtr
is
able
to
produce
two
products
,
hydrogen
and
electricity
-
concurrently
,
it
helps
to
reduce
the
cost
of
producing
both
products
separately
.

during
the
construction
of
a
new
nuclear
plant
-
around
1400
to
as
high
as
2400
jobs
is
created
.

when
come
to
analyze
and
select
solution
,
here
we
need
to
decide
which
solution
is
the
best
suited
for
implementation
to
the
problem
.

there
are
many
areas
where
public
spending
should
be
used
for
a
country
's
development
.

i
do
understand
that
not
all
elderly
would
have
families
or
are
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
.

also
,
as
its
fuel
cycle
is
closed
,
there
is
no
need
for
-
offsite
emergency
response
-
-
the
system
will
shut
down
without
spreading
radioactive
materials
.

when
people
find
out
about
the
test
,
knowing
them
might
have
the
genes
,
the
stress
level
will
increases
in
turn
their
health
will
be
affected
.

the
two
-
ways
of
developing
technologies
have
different
processes
.

although
it
is
a
continuous
battle
against
the
impact
of
aging
population
on
our
societies
,
given
the
support
and
coordination
between
the
government
,
voluntary
welfare
organizations
(
vwo
)
,
-
community
and
individuals
and
through
these
coherent
blueprints
of
policies
and
researches
mapped
out
meticulously
by
governments
,
the
aging
process
of
various
countries
are
believed
to
be
able
to
be
eased
,
if
not
overcame
.

it
has
been
estimated
that
there
will
be
a
four-fold
increase
in
the
utilization
of
health
resources
in
2030
,
based
on
the
increased
numbers
of
-
elderly
and
assuming
the
same
utilization
rate
.

the
government
is
aware
of
this
situation
and
they
have
come
up
with
a
solution
to
overcome
this
problem
by
linking
up
acute
hospitals
with
community
ones
.

first
way
is
changing
the
way
energy
is
generated
,
such
as
changing
petrol
engines
which
produce
carbon
dioxide
and
hydrocarbons
to
fuel
cell
which
only
produce
water
and
oxygen
.

the
development
on
education
sector
will
enable
the
further
generations
to
be
more
educated
and
to
possess
a
higher
level
of
skills
.

for
example
,
-
landslide
occurs
on
-
work
site
due
to
soil
erosion
after
the
heavy
downpour
.

living
expenditure
for
the
elderly
is
increased
by
the
rising
medical
costs
and
standard
of
living
.

)
.

even
if
it
does
,
more
often
than
not
,
it
would
take
years
before
the
end
product
can
be
sold
to
the
general
public
for
use
.

apart
from
the
loopholes
in
the
system
of
state-owned
enterprises
,
economic
shortage
of
china
's
private
companies
also
hampers
the
innovation
process
.

if
it
can
be
integrated
together
,
the
safety
of
-
scwr
will
be
enhanced
dramatically
.

a
decrease
in
the
spending
to
fulfill
the
constant
needs
of
an
aging
population
will
not
be
worthwhile
to
incur
the
economic
loss
resulted
from
the
communication
breakdown
.

the
second
advantage
of
vhtr
is
that
it
does
not
only
produce
electricity
but
at
the
same
time
create
hydrogen
fuel
as
well
(
butler
,
2004
)
.

as
a
result
,
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
not
be
limited
as
it
is
needed
to
help
these
elderly
.

in
this
way
,
companies
can
make
their
goal
in
a
much
faster
way
.

these
information
is
further
recorded
and
processed
by
the

for
instant
,
in
the
process
of

,

be
generated
,
which
may
contribute
to
global
warming
.

therefore
,

environment
usually
are
not
comfortable
to
work
in
.

aging
is
the
accumulation
of
changes
in
an
organism
or
object
over
time
.

also
the
containment
structures
of
modern
reactors
were
designed
to
effectively
prevent
the
escape
of
radioactivity
even
if
it
sustained
severe
damages
.

these
inventions
have
indeed
help
a
lot
in
easing
the
aging
process
.

till
now
,
heart
attack
has
become
the
top
one
killer
among
all
the
disease
which
threatens
the
human
's
health
.

in
conclusion
,
surveillance
technology
should
not
be
banned
to
track
people
as
it
not
only
can
save
life
but
also
improves
the
healthcare
sector
while
enhancing
the
security
of
our
society
.

technologies
invention
has
played
another
imperative
role
to
ease
the
process
of
ageing
.

hence
,
the
individual
should
have
the
final
say
in
whether
to
reveal
the
results
of
such
testing
.

cpf
requires
employees
to
save
for
their
retirement
years
whilst
they
are
still
working
.

it
means
you
have
to
pay
nearly
$
6000
per
month
for
caring
-
your
parents
,
which
is
such
a
large
amount
especially
in
the
economic
critics
recently
.

locating
the
sunshades
at
remote
areas
,
reduce
the
probability
of
injuries
in
case
of
any
accident
.

in
other
words
,
most
elderly
-
are
rather
dependent
on
their
children
to
support
them
-
particularly
those
who
suffered
from
chronic
illnesses
.

-
post-it
note
was
invented
in
this
way
according
to
rogers
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
danger
of
nuclear
radiation
,
fear
of
terrorism
and
the
high
initial
and
running
cost
of
a
generation
iv
nuclear
plant
,
makes
us
consider
if
there
are
any
other
alternatives
.

terrorists
can
also
have
the
chance
to
magnify
the
destruction
by
attack
the
nuclear
plant
and
the
freighters
that
convey
radioactive
substance
.

besides
,
the
introduction
of
-
central
provident
fund
(
cpf
)
,
a
mandatory
saving
scheme
,
is
also
a
policy
carried
out
by
-
government
to
ease
the
aging
process
.

this
will
have
the
effect
of
helping
them
to
be
financially
independent
even
beyond
their
retirement
age
.

it
also
allows
us
to
utilize
more
capable
generation
iv
reactors
sooner
and
helps
reduce
the
amount
of
nuclear
wastes
.

they
would
end
up
living
on
the
streets
if
no
help
is
given
to
them
.

thus
,
to
prevent
relatives
or
parents
to
think
negatively
,
a
carrier
of
a
known
genetic
risk
should
not
be
obligated
to
tell
his
or
her
relatives
.

as
some
may
argue
,
maintenance
also
needs
money
and
may
lead
to
the
increase
in
the
average
costs
.

subsequently
two
explosions
occurred
resulting
in
massive
losses
(
chernobyl
accident
,
2009
)
.

moreover
,
part
of
the
public
fund
should
also
be
spend
on
re-training
schemes
for
working
adults
so
as
to
improve
their
work
quality
and
efficiency
,
as
well
as
to
keep
them
skilled
and
valuable
for
the
industry
.

in
details
,
the
cost
can
be
reduced
by
reducing
the
refuelling
outages
'
number
,
compacting
the
reactor
vessel
,
sampling
the
vessel
internals
,
reducing
the
loop
number
,
shortening
the
pipes
,
integrating
the
primary
components
and
so
on
.

for
example
,
research
and
development
in
pharmaceutical
is
particularly
important
as
the
creation
of
new
drugs
will
help
in
the
advancement
of
medical
and
clinical
studies
.

in
my
opinion
,
the
contribution
of
current
researches
and
technology
is
very
important
in
easing
-
aging
process
.

among
all
those
socially
determined
resistance
on
the
way
of
innovation
,
one
fatally
significant
phenomenon
is
the
unfair
competition
between
monopolies
and
other
less
competent
companies
.

firstly
,
many
companies
lack
money
to
support
innovations
in
their
product
design
.

however
,
according
to
the
gif
,
the
six
concepts
,
including
the
vhtr
,
had
incorporated
a
high
security-proof
mechanism
.

there
is
also
another
design
feature
of
vhtr
that
makes
it
a
preferable
choice
of
reactor
over
scwr
.

together
with
the
increase
of
unemployment
rates
in
singapore
,
it
presents
a
worrying
trend
of
its
citizen
entering
the
retirement
age
of
their
life
.

afonso
's
view
supports
my
stand
that
public
funds
should
be
diverting
into
-
education
system
is
fundamental
.

-
chernobyl
accident
gives
people
a
big
shock
.

because
without
having
a
proper
testing
at
all
stages
in
the
process
,
you
may
find
yourself
into
trouble
later
on
.

the
next
question
-
needs
to
be
debated
is
:
``
how
much
money
should
the
government
spend
on
the
medical
care
for
elder
people
?
``
.

the
vhtr
is
equipped
with
superior
passive
safety
feature
with
its
underground
construction
,
which
also
greatly
increases
its
security
and
physical
protection
.

however
,
it
is
the
individual
's
responsibility
to
tell
his
family
members
regarding
this
.

in
order
to
develop
our
society
without
exhausting
all
the
fossil
fuels
or
sacrificing
our
environment
,
we
have
to
find
new
energy
resources
to
take
-
place
of
traditional
fossil
fuels
.

despite
scandinavian
welfare
state
such
as
france
,
countries
like
singapore
who
have
long
promulgate
self-reliance
do
adopt
certain
policy
framework
for
example
the
3m
's
,
medisave
,
medishield
and
medifund
simultaneously
with
eldershield
-
to
protect
and
support
citizen
on
the
skyrocket
healthcare
cost
.

to
add
on
,
network
effect
,
an
economics
jargon
meaning
that
people
incline
to
stay
in
the
network
unless
their
followers
leave
,
also
do
help
xiaonei.com
secure
its
market
share
.

in
addition
,
the
introduction
of
health
related
welfare
schemes
for
the
aged
is
also
one
of
the
main
solutions
.

i
agree
that
other
areas
do
need
public
funding
,
and
indeed
money
have
to
be
spent
on
it
.

many
had
also
argued
that
terrorists
were
able
to
collect
these
by-products
and
use
them
as
a
weapon
.

however
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
implementation
of
psychology
can
help
to
anticipate
some
events
that
led
to
the
accident
;
therefore
allowing
designers
to
prepare
for
such
emergencies
.

the
generation
iv
international
forum
(
gif
)
,
a
research
and
development
group
organized
by
ten
nations
to
carry
out
-
the
next
generation
-
nuclear
energy
,
is
identifying
and
selecting
six
nuclear
energy
systems
with
-
variety
of
reactors
,
energy
conversion
systems
,
and
fuel
cycle
technologies
.

this
implies
that
there
will
be
a
labour
shortage
of
experienced
workers
who
are
able
to
contribute
to
the
labour
force
after
they
have
retired
.

secondly
government
policies
reforms
have
impact
the
lives
of
the
aged
positively
.

in
addition
,
some
would
argue
that
it
is
of
-
social
obligation
that
this
should
be
done
.

in
the
first
place
,
all
technologies
need
to
go
through
a
series
of
precise
experiments
and
research
.

this
is
to
ensure
that
the
elderly
will
have
enough
-
and
are
ready
for
old
age
.

when
judge
a
new
energy
,
the
engineers
have
to
think
about
the
questions
,
such
as
-
``
is
the
energy
able
to
replace
petrol
?

numerous
civil
right
groups
and
privacy
groups
oppose
and
regard
it
as
a
severe
violation
of
the
tight
of
privacy
and
freedom
.

only
then
,
singapore
will
be
a
successful
``
civilization
''
.

the
result
of
the
explosion
had
linked
to
many
forms
of
cancer
in
eastern
europe
and
russia
,
as
well
as
destroying
animals
and
plants
.

the
government
should
limit
on
public
spending
on
healthcare
for
the
aged
,
and
the
limit
should
satisfy
the
healthcare
needs
of
all
the
elderly
.

another
is
that
both
type
of
technology
requires
people
to
ultilise
a
certain
amount
of
creativity
and
good
peception
to
develope
them
completely
but
differ
when
it
comes
to
the
type
of
people
it
usually
involves
.

thus
,
these
policies
are
ineffective
without
first
changing
the
mindset
of
employers
and
would
eventually
cause
social
and
economical
problems
in
the
society
.

in
conclusion
,
surveillance
technology
should
be
banned
as
it
invade
our
privacy
and
disturb
the
society
which
outweighs
the
ability
to
provide
security
,
which
might
not
be
necessary
true
.

in
fact
,
it
calls
into
the
question
whether
the
elderly
really
benefits
from
the
policy
implemented
in
the
aspect
of
financial
security
,
employment
and
living
arrangements
for
elderly
.

hence
,
we
can
conclude
that
social
factors
can
determine
the
fortune
of
a
new
technology
.

in
addition
,
resource
crisis
,
especially
the
shortage
of
water
,
pushes
the
development
of
newater
.

admittedly
,
genetic
testing
raises
legal
issue
,
however
,
an
individual
who
tested
positive
for
a
genetic
disease
has
to
decide
whether
to
make
known
the
results
of
genetic
testing
to
relevant
third
parties
such
as
family
members
or
relatives
who
have
the
possibility
of
passing
on
the
similar
disease
.

by
increasing
public
spending
on
an
aging
population
,
governments
risk
overlooking
important
areas
of
the
country
's
development
at
the
expense
of
the
country
's
overall
well
being
.

however
,
this
potential
peril
can
be
avoided
by
testing
and
choosing
suitable
materials
which
can
withstand
huge
pressure
and
corrosion
.

the
salts
can
keep
the
reactor
's
temperature
at
around
700
oc
,
which
is
acceptable
in
comparison
with
the
others
.

before
taking
effective
actions
,
leaders
must
first
realise
that
any
further
expansion
of
retirement
benefits
would
only
impoverish
future
generations
and
limit
future
public
spending
(
peterson
,
p.g
.

another
problem
we
face
in
singapore
is
the
lack
of
experience
our
country
has
in
the
innovative
engineering
field
.

however
,
this
is
rarely
seen
due
to
the
fact
that
most
of
them
do
not
wish
to
continue
working
into
old
age
,
they
believe
that
they
deserve
to
rest
.

molten
lead
,
compared
to
helium
,
is
a
superior
and
cheaper
heat
transfer
medium
-
and
hence
increasing
the
portability
of
the
power
plant
by
reducing
the
need
for
a
large
intermediate
heat
exchanger
.

if
the
decision
is
leaved
to
others
,
the
chance
of
perfect
equality
is
also
questionable
.

secondly
,
an
article
on
electronic
privacy
information
center
(
anonymous
2005
)
highlighted
that
using
rfid
to
track
children
-
movement
and
location
not
only
invades
their
privacy
but
can
also
be
very
detrimental
to
their
dignity
.

singaporeans
are
required
to
save
a
certain
amount
of
their
salaries
into
their
cpf
accounts
.

some
consider
that
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
so
that
money
can
be
diverted
to
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

a
new
scheme
,
wellness
programme
was
created
recently
to
promote
healthy
lifestyle
and
social
networking
for
citizens
-
especially
the
elderly
(
pmo
,
2009
)
.

v.
and
schuknecht
,
2000
)
,
only
then
can
the
economies
as
well
as
the
aging
population
benefit
healthily
from
the
effective
use
of
tax
payers
'
money
.

apart
from
that
,
-
government
's
initiative
in
raising
the
retirement
age
is
also
blamed
to
be
not
effective
.

disease
has
been
a
great
concern
of
human
from
-
very
long
time
ago
,
but
medical
system
seems
not
to
be
enough
in
the
fight
with
countless
threats
that
steals
many
human
lives
.there
are
many
limitations
that
only
can
be
surpassed
by
the
magic
of
engineers
'
technology
.

finally
,
we
could
say
that
the
process
of
the
aircraft
innovation
was
quite
devious
.

in
addition
,
nuclear
wastes
repositories
require
geological
isolation
over
in
areas
like
yucca
mountain
.

with
the
integration
of
both
rfid
and
global
positioning
system
(
gps
)
,
it
is
used
to
locate
workers
'
during
emergencies
.

for
example
,
the
rising
cost
of
health
spending
for
the
elderly
has
taken
its
toll
on
them
and
many
could
not
afford
that
.

however
,
the
use
of
nuclear
weapons
on
another
country
has
been
non-existent
since
wwii
as
countries
realize
the
chaos
it
could
cause
.

singapore
's
transportation
system
is
well-known
as
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
.

no
one
can
guarantee
that
children
who
live
nearby
their
parents
will
eventually
take
good
care
of
their
parents
.

this
event
would
turn
out
differently
if
the
management
teams
of
the
building
were
psychologically
prepared
,
in
other
words
,
educated
or
briefed
on
such
issues
,
the
building
would
have
been
evacuated
almost
immediately
,
even
having
a
buffer
time
of
16
hours
on
hand
to
do
it
,
saving
the
life
of
33
and
even
possible
to
conduct
remedy
to
the
building
.

therefore
,
they
believe
that
even
though
'work
scientist
'
could
probably
remove
human
factors
psychologically
,
the
hardware
technical
problems
would
still
trigger
similar
accidents
by
themselves
.

therefore
-
a
large
part
of
the
safety
of
the
engineering
systems
lies
on
human
activities
.

hydrogen
gas
has
been
produced
,
but
the
transmission
is
still
a
hard
work.we
need
a
high-pressure
and
low-temperature
surroundings
to
let
the
hydrogen
be
liquid.but
it
is
very
hard
to
make
that
kind
of
surroundings
in
normal
life.we
need
a
kind
of
catalyst
to
make
the
hydrogen
be
liquid
at
normal
temperature
and
pressure
.

in
order
to
achieve
safer
operating
environment
,
government
should
fund
the
development
of
the
gen
iv
.

in
this
essay
,
how
does
engineering
design
processes
-
cope
with
the
energy
crisis
will
be
discussed
in
terms
of
gathering
pertinent
information
and
analysis
and
selection
of
an
optimized
solution
.

government
needs
to
focus
the
spending
on
more
important
sectors
first
like
economic
development
before
worrying
about
healthcare
for
the
elderly
.

anyhow
,
as
a
member
in
the
family
,
it
is
obligated
to
tell
the
genetic
test
results
to
-
own
relatives
.

furthermore
,
when
considering
the
design
of
the
product
,
there
is
a
need
to
make
special
considerations
that
are
suitable
for
the
elderly
use
.

everyone
should
-
responsible
and
play
-
important
role
in
the
family
.

as
mentioned
earlier
,
one
reason
why
we
should
not
limit
the
spending
is
that
it
may
not
be
fair
to
the
elderly
when
the
public
spending
is
limited
as
among
the
elderly
,
there
may
be
people
who
are
really
in
great
need
of
the
support
from
the
government
.

second
,
the
lta
's
personnel
,
due
to
slothfulness
,
did
not
do
his/her
job
on
ensuring
the
safety
of
building
works
by
performing
checks
on
-
construction
work
.

the
upgrading
process
might
cause
inconveniences
to
the
residents
but
-
is
a
pay
off
that
they
have
to
bear
with
for
a
better
tomorrow
.

the
debiting
and
crediting
process
is
automated
,
thus
the
citizen
need
not
do
anything
but
he
will
still
be
notified
regularly
with
his
cpf
account
statement
.

swcr
does
not
recycle
the
waste
which
is
not
that
safe
.

there
are
various
non-profitable
organizations
all
over
the
world
seeking
cure
for
common
illness
among
elderly
an
example
will
be
for
parkinson
disease
there
is
the
parkinson
's
institute
and
clinical
center
in
america
.

hence
,
we
still
should
not
limit
the
public
spending
on
the
aged
.

one
reason
for
revealing
the
result
to
the
family
members
is
that
the
result
is
not
only
applicable
to
the
individual
but
also
to
other
family
members
,
as
they
may
also
have
inherited
the
diseases
.

the
design
engineers
were
said
to
put
so
much
effort
into
these
trivial
factors
rather
than
the
safety
concern
.

even
in
the
midnight
,
there
still
must
have
workers
to
monitor
the
system
to
ensure
that
the
system
is
functional
for
24
hours
.

for
my
home
country
,
china
,
although
its
design
process
for
innovation
has
been
improved
a
lot
,
there
still
remain
several
factors
which
hamper
-
the
innovation
process
significantly
.

but
since
the
living
cost
in
singapore
has
been
so
high
that
it
is
even
called
as
the
10th
most
expensive
city
-
(
hoe
,
2009
)
,
-
government
may
consider
increasing
-

therefore
,
increasing
the

number
of

and
reducing
the

.

it
is
inevitable
that
public

will
significantly
increase
with
the

.

besides

during

only
the

the

it

on

majority
of

in

in

modern

of

the

was

it

to

reliable

over
the
years
it
does
not

any

however
,
surveillance

is
a

;
all

can
be
used
in

.

the
crisis
will
almost
be

if
we
take
these

solutions
into

.

this
is
indeed
true
;
however
,
the
cost
of
building

is
in
fact
not
as
costly
as
the
other

.

but
because
of
-
large
scale
and
many
other
factors
involved
,
it
will
take

and
more

to
finish

affect

hence
-
japan
invented

of

due
to

[

however
,
this
is
insufficient
as
there
are
also
many
benefits
that
lifelong
learning
can
exert
on
oneself
.

this
is
because
,
technology
provides
the
automation
and
machines
to
increase
productivity
solving
the
problem
of
a
shrinking
workforce
.

i
agree
to
a
certain
extent
that
current
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
so
that
this
excess
money
could
be
used
in
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

however
,
these
social
factors
,
which
were
partly
caused
by
the
overpowering
economical
and
political
factors
,
``
pushed
''
people
to
choose
the
gasoline-
powered
vehicles
.

however
,
we
should
consider
who
should
be
given
priority
and
deserve
-
national
budget
the
most
.

by
diverting
the
money
to
develop
the
economics
,
the
government
will
be
able
to
create
more
working
fields
so
that
they
can
reduce
the
unemployment
rate
as
well
as
increase
the
gross
domestic
product
,
which
is
the
indicator
of
the
economic
health
and
standard
of
living
in
a
country
,
of
their
own
country
.

their
contribution
to
the
society
should
at
least
be
recognized
and
to
a
certain
extend
rewarded
for
.

while
it
is
true
that
the
extreme
circumstances
mentioned
do
exist
in
the
society
,
one
must
agree
that
relatives
have
their
reserved
rights
too
,
to
know
about
the
presence
of
genetic
risk
within
the
family
because
no
one
has
exclusive
rights
over
his
or
her
genes
as
they
are
shared
among
the
family
.

an
individual
who
wish
to
start
a
family
with
his
spouse
should
reveal
the
testing
result
.

thus
the
need
to
divert
reserves
into
this
area
of
the
society
is
very
important
.

this
is
because
of
red
wine
contains
a
substance
known
as
``
resveratol
''
.

however
,
there
is
no
guarantee
that
a
psychologist
can
trigger
a
better
mind
set
among
the
designers
.

yahya
mehdizadeh
in
digital
energy
journal
september
2007
stated
that
``
-
by
implanting
rfid
chips
within
the
-
person
or
within
the
gear
of
rig
professionals
operators
can
validate
that
those
persons
are
at
the
right
place
during
important
phases
of
production
.
''

first
and
foremost
,
renewable
-
fuels
are
much
more
environmentally
friendly
compared
with
fossil
fuels
.

the
damping
up
of
rivers
to
form
water
catchment
areas
is
in
fact
being
implemented
.

the
cost
of
the
nuclear
plant
can
be
divided
into
3
main
parts
:
capital
cost
,
operating
cost
and
fuel
cost
.

for
example
,
-
singapore
government
gives
different
type
of
incentive
and
benefit
to
support
parenthood
to
have
and
raise
children
.

firstly
,
the
physician
is
a
profession
that
is
bounded
with
standard
protocols
and
most
importantly
the
physician
possesses
medical
ethics
.

therefore
,
the
government
has
been
promoting
active
aging
to
help
the
elderly
to
engage
in
a
healthy
and
happy
lifestyle
.

and
i
have
absolute
trust
in
scientists
to
iron
out
the
flaws
to
make
rfid
truly
the
``
perfect
''
solution
to
many
existing
limited
technology
.

besides
the
complexity
amount
of
anti-aging
medicine
available
in
the
market
,
the
advanced
technology
has
also
helped
to
ease
a
generation
into
old
age
despite
the
fact
that
some
elderly
-
might
not
be
able
to
accept
these
complex
technologies
.

this
allows
elders
how
to
less
physical
capabilities
in
their
work
.

one
-
such
technology
was
the
mobile
phone
.

national
budgets
and
economies
will
come
under
pressure
as
growing
numbers
of
-
elderly
persons
are
supported
by
relatively
fewer
younger
persons
.

this
allows
the
country
to
save
funds
which
are
not
unnecessary
needed
to
provide
.

in
addition
,
an
increase
of
infrastructure
can
attract
investment
from
abroad
because
the
facilities
are
fully
equipped
.

the
results
from
the
testing
will
be
sent
to
who
for
approval
to
desalination
plant
to
be
build
for
producing
drinkable
water
in
the
area
.

however
,
even
though
the
disclosure
empowers
one
's
relatives
-
take
precaution
measures
,
it
might
end
up
causing
an
increased
anxiety
among
family
members
(
cancer.net
editorial
board
,
2009
)
.

many
policies
have
been
implemented
and
research
and
development
have
been
improved
in
the
last
several
years
but
more
remains
are
to
be
done
.

therefore
,
indicating
that
there
should
not
be
funding
for
-
scwr
.

being
in
the
same
family
,
it
is
one
's
responsibility
to
taking
care
of
each
other
's
well-being
(
forrest
k
,
2003
)
.

``
that
's
why
fitness
facilities
,
children
's
playground
and
elderly
exercise
equipment
are
put
together
''
quoted
mr
mah
bt
(
2008
)
in
a
housing
speech
.

when
scientists
or
enterprisers
decide
to
adopt
a
new
technology
,
the
social
factors
will
directly
affect
their
decisions
.

some
may
argue
that
fruit
and
gymnastic
do
not
play
any
part
in
easing
the
aging
process
.

the
elderly
needed
some
form
of
monitoring
technology
to
help
improve
their
safety
where
no
one
is
able
to
be
around
to
look
after
them
all
the
time
.

employers
who
claim
that
-
elderly
are
ability
and
mobility
restricted
will
also
no
longer
having
any
excuse
to
reject
elderly
-
who
wish
to
work
in
their
organization
.

hence
defence
posture
and
military
strategy
should
be
deeply
thought
of
to
prevent
lost
of
our
men
.

subsequently
,
various
groups
of
experts
from
the
nuclear
and
chemical
industry
investigated
into
this
case
,
and
some
of
them
came
into
a
conclusion
that
the
most
essential
way
to
prevent
such
-
catastrophe
from
happening
again
lied
in
the
enhancement
of
-
psychological
education
to
people
;
whereas
the
others
opposed
that
the
main
problem
was
actually
the
design
failures
of
the
plant
,
and
the
prevention
could
hardly
be
simply
regarded
as
a
psychological
issue
.

for
example
,
in
my
country
,
many
projects
had
to
be
postponed
because
there
are
not
enough
materials
to
make
the
products
.

with
the
rising
inflation
,
both
married
children
have
to
work
to
support
the
increasing
expenditures
.

the
development
in
the
field
of
economics
has
surprisingly
contributed
in
easing
the
aging
population
-
.

(
gerald
p.
o'driscoll
-

)
-
besides
,
consider
solely
on
the
economic
perspective
,
singapore
will
never
be
a
leading
nation
if
there
is
no
control
but
relinquishment
over
public
spending
with
abrupt
and
undefined
monetary
policies
,
basically
meaning
that
there
is
justification
to
the
planning
of
public
spending
.

from
the
hindered
growth
of
nuclear
energy
in
north
korea
,
we
can
see
that
the
abuse
of
nuclear
power
such
as
scwrs
is
less
likely
to
happen
nowadays
.

hence
,
this
design
reduces
the
probability
of
nuclear
arms
proliferation
.

however
,
some
experts
have
pointed
out
that
if
such
high
temperature
is
stimulated
within
a
reactor
,
new
hardy
alloy
may
be
necessary
to
protect
the
inside
layer
of
the
reactor
.

the
recycling
is
done
only
for
the
completely
used
uranium
fuel
.

as
these
costs
decline
,
businesses
become
more
profitable
when
they
effectively
try
to
make
use
of
the
incentive
from
the
government
and
ultimately
translate
to
better
salaries
for
consumerism
.

looking
at
singapore
for
example
,
there
are
only
5
cng
refueling
points
around
the
country
.

as
reported
in
the
news
last
year
,
west
virginia
decided
to
use
video
surveillance
technology
on
its
highways
to
help
in
the
finding
of
missing
children
(
stump
,
2008
,
p.1
)
which
resulted
in
one
hundred
percent
recovery
of
the
missing
children
(
stump
,
2008
,
p.2
)
.

globalization
has
caused
the
demand
of
oil
to
surge
up
to
the
extent
by
which
the
supply
of
crude
oil
could
not
match
the
demand
for
it
,
hence
leading
to
a
shortage
for
oil
.

also
,
nuclear
reactors
are
operational
only
for
around
fifty
years
,
requiring
regular
costly
replacements

in
addition
,
we
realized
that
burning
of
fuels
produce
the
large
amount
of
greenhouse
gases
.

the
public
spending
used
for
the
elderly
such
as
healthcare
,
pension
and
welfare
programs
can
be
diverted
into
development
sectors
instead
.

much
should
be
done
to
help
ease
the
aging
process
to
avoid
social
and
economical
problems
in
the
future
.

in
view
of
the
rising
fuel
prices
in
the
recent
decade
,
car
manufacturers
have
addressed
the
need
to
reduce
costs
in
production
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
pass
on
minimal
costs
to
the
consumers
,
yet
still
remain
competitive
and
appealing
in
the
market
.

reference
:

the
concept
is
that
when
they
are
still
in
working
age
,
some
of
their
income
will
be
put
into
savings
.

as
such
-
,
usage
of
rfid
to
track
individuals
should
be
banned
.

moreover
,
their
passions
are
-
same
as
others
.

but
he
only
invented
a
kind
of
material
which
was
bright
luster
than
other
materials
but
-
not
strong
enough
.

the
people
were
made
to
believe
that
the
gasoline-powered
vehicle
was
the
``
byproduct
of
market
competition
and
engineering
advancement
,
not
-
a
product
of
compromise
and
negotiation
''
(
dr.
sovacool
,
28
august

)
,
which
,
in
actual
fact
,
was
not
.

additionally
,
we
are
encouraging
young
couples
to
have
more
children
,
urging
working-aged
immigrants
to
come
,
inventing
more
ways
to
reduce
the
cost
for
health
...
tackling
this
fast
aging
problem
is
tremendously
because
it
is
hard
to
be
eliminated
absolutely
.

if
engineers
can
think
more
about
-
environment
when
designing
,
the
product
will
become
very
environment-friendly
.

it
works
with
the
logic
of
letting
children
take
care
of
their
own
parents
,
which
considerably
effective
under
asian
cultures
and
contexts
.

with
a
large
pool
of
possible
uses
for
telfon
gathered
,
the
next
step
would
be
to
modify
this
new
technology
so
that
it
may
be
used
for
as
many
of
the
problems
as
possible
.

using
of
surveillance
technology
has
no
impact
for
those
focusing
on
work
and
doing
the
right
thing

first
,
vhtr
is
performed
under
very
high
temperature
,
therefore
allowing
for
more
efficient
conversion
of
heat
to
electricity
.

in
the
event
that
an
individual
is
not
-
able
to
pay
the
minimum
amount
,
they
can
apply
for
the
medifund
,
which
is
an
endowment
plan
funded
by
the
nation
's
economic
growth
,
targeted
to
help
those
who
still
can
not
afford
to
pay
the
bills
despite
already
being
heavily
subsided
.

based
on
``
the
network
of
power
''
,
a
book
by
thomas
hughes
,
it
addresses
one
pertinent
problem
on
the
way
we
view
technology
.

after
reviewing
this
accident
,
some
experts
may
feel
that
incorporating
a
psychologist
into
the
developmental
process
could
aid
in
preventing
it
.

these
planes
are
not
only
a
mark
of
development
in
speed
but
also
in
agility
.

public
spending
on
the
aged
covers
many
aspects
of
their
life
,
starting
from
healthcare
until
their
living
place
.

hence
,
we
must
be
flexible
and
focused
to
know
which
direction
our
country
is
heading
towards
and
plan
adequate
resources
properly
.

towards
its
development
to
today
's
technology
,
the
policy
maker
played
an
important
part
in
it
.

both
-
smallpox
vaccine
and
penicillin
are
tremendous
discoveries
that
save
people
's
lives
and
they
are
milestone
in
medicine
that
lead
people
to
explore
new
areas
to
fight
diseases
;
however
,
the
procedure
of
finding
these
two
discoveries
and
the
development
of
them
are
different
.

to
conclude
,
revealing
of
the
positive
results
is
essential
to
help
not
only
the
carriers
,
but
also
their
family
psychologically
and
physically
.

another
contributing
factor
of
the
success
of
invention
will
be
the
buying
power
of
-
consumer
,
which
very
much
depends
on
the
economic
situation
then
.

the
abundance
of
uranium
on
earth
also
means
that
it
is
a
more
powerful
way
of
generating
electricity
.

during
the
last
decade
,
the
number
of
newater
plants
increases
to
four
.

it
will
help
reduce
carbon
dioxide
and
subsequently
reduce
the
effect
of
global
warming
(
jacques
&
ralph
,
2008
)
.

it
is
therefore
crucial
to
maintain
or
improve
its
image
of
doing
so
.

it
is
relatively
hard
to
deny
how
much
ageing
had
been
made
much
easier
.

in
other
words
,
governments
highly
appreciate
the
contribution
of
old
people
in
the
past
and
try
to
offer
them
more
but
the
budget
constraint
calls
for
limiting
in
order
to
develop
other
aspects
of
society
.

when
extracted
and
processed
,
enriched
uranium
-
can
become
a
key
material
for
the
manufacture
of
nuclear
weapons
.

for
most
countries
,
part
of
their
national
budget
will
be
spent
on
funding
the
aged
each
year
.

thus
society
should
limit
their
spending
on
the
aged
and
shift
their
focus
onto
the
young
,
nurturing
them
.

however
,
after
major
nuclear
incidents
such
as
the
chernobyl
disaster
,
the
general
public
have
became
skeptical
about
the
safety
of
nuclear
power
.

automation
throughout
the
reactors
and
passive
safety
features
are
just
some
of
the
technology
implemented
to
make
the
generation
iv
reactors
safer
.

hence
,
public
spending
should
not
be
limited
,
in
fact
we
should
even
divert
more
funds
to
similar
projects
that
will
cater
to
the
needs
of
an
older
population
as
they
will
after
all
make
up
a
significant
amount
in
singapore
,
-
thus
more
focus
should
be
placed
on
them
.

the
report
(
the
international
nuclear
safety
advisory
group
,
1992
)
by
the
international
nuclear
safety
advisory
group
(

)
-
states
that
-
three
components
of
reactor
protection
,
which
referred
to
-

)
,
-

on
steam
drum
water
level
,
and
the
'two
turbine
'
trip
had
been
disabled
.

so
we
do
not
need
to
worry
-
big
catastrophes
like
-
chernobyl
accident
will
repeat
again
.

for
example
,
an
effective
solution
to
the
ageing
population
is
increasing
the
percentage
in
the
governments
'
treasuries
of
other
factors
such
as
-
economy
,
science
,
transportation
,
education
and
some
areas
else
.

other
technologies
like
the
anti-blink
function
and
the
smile
shutter
function
-
which
automatically
capture
the
best
facial
expressions
-
are
also
developed
in
the
need
for
simpler
photo
taking
(

.

according
to
the
national
bureau
of
statistics
,
the
expenditure
of
the
government
on
education
last
year
was
rmb
901
billion
and
on
r
&
d
was
even
lower
,
rmb
213
billion
(

of
finance
of
china
,

)
.

although
the
government
's
spending
on
the
aged
may
be
minimised
to
develop
a
country
's
infrastructure
for
greater
economic
benefits
,
there
should
be
at
least
some
effort
by
the
government
to
satisfy
the
social
needs
of
the
older
citizens
by
building
an
elder-friendly
place
,
making
-
a
comfortable
place
for
them
to
live
in
.

moreover
,
for
retail
company
,
rfid
is
also
a
possible
tool
for
them
to
reduce
theft
and
sabotage
.

this
will
ensure
that
the
majority
of
the
fuel
is
burnt
in
the
process
,
leaving
very
low
level
of
enriched
fuel
remaining
that
can
be
extracted
for
use
for
the
manufacture
of
nuclear
weapons
.

critics
of
this
position
pointed
out
that
the
cost
of
providing
pensions
leads
-
the
increased
taxes
on
the
workforce
.

with
longer
average
life
expectancies
in
the
ageing
population
,
demand
for
a
good
healthcare
system
to
be
in
place
is
critical
.

an
example
is
the
very
high
temperature
reactor
(
vhtr
)
which
boasts
a
super
helium
coolant
which
is
much
more
effective
than
water
,
and
yet
it
is
both
inert
and
unreactive
(
teri
ehresman
,
2009
)
.

as
a
result
,
scientists
choose
another
generation
of
resource
--
--
nuclear
power
.

it
is
an
indispensable
asset
that
many
countries
strongly
support
and
endeavor
to
adopt
.

lastly
it
has
better
system
which
would
prevent
similar
incidents
of
-
meltdown
of
the
nuclear
power
reactor
to
happen
.

it
is
just
a
switch
in
roles
from
governments
to
families
and
individuals
to
shoulder
these
expenses
,
which
most
of
the
case
actually
involved
a
higher
cost
(

&
summer
,
march

)
.
'

besides
taking
care
for
the
aged
,
there
are
several
other
areas
the
government
should
put
the
same
amount
of
emphasis
on
when
dividing
how
much
each
sector
should
get
from
the
national
budget
.

in
addition
,
the
government
had
already
done
his
part
in
preparing
its
citizens
for

through
the

and
medisave
account
.

in
fact
,
the
risk
and
severity
of
certain
adult
onset
genetic
disorders
can
be
alleviated
by
preventative
measures
and
treatments
.

the
chernobyl
disaster
,
especially
,
exposed
millions
of
people
to
radioactive
chemicals
and
has
been
linked
to
many
forms
of
cancer
in
eastern
europe
and
russia
,
as
well
as
destroying
animals
and
plants
.

can
not
choose
everything
to
develop
because

as

and

invented
by
carl
.

as
such
,
it
has
been
known
that
many
insurance
companies
tend
to
deny
individuals
essential
health
care
based
on
their
genetic
disposition
(
-
anonymous
,
2005
)
.

particularly
,
the
power
output
of
the
molten
salt
reactor
system
includes
both
electricity
and
hydrogen
,
which
can
also
be
used
for
other
purposes
.

due
to
the
lack
of
treatment
strategies
of
-
some
genetic
disorders
,
a
carrier
might
have
a
short
lifespan
.

hence
,
this
shows
that
despite
the
increase
in
the
spending
for
the
aged
,
it
does
not
mean
that
the
other
areas
of
development
will
be
neglected
as
each
development
plays
an
important
part
in
the
growth
of
the
country
.

with
the
financial
support
from
-
company
,
the
research
and
development
team
can
have
-
comfortable
and
productive
workspace
.

engineers

in
renewable
resources

hence
,
this
is
where
the
role
of
public
spending
should
come
in
the
play
of
addressing
the
needs
of
the
aged
.

although
some
people
claim
that
old
people
enjoy
each
other
's
company
more
than
that
of
the
young
people
,
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
an
old
person
feeling
very
happy
with
only
rare
visits
from
his
or
her
family
.

people
wonder
the
existence
of
suitable
material
to
build
this
reactor
.

when
it
comes
to
the
information
technology
,
every
young
man
should
be
familiar
with
it
.

thus
,
it
largely
reduces
the
possibility
to
cause
explosion
or
other
accidents
.

the
problems
brought
by
the
unbalanced
energy
source
distribution
are
solved
.

in
their
opinion
,
government
should
spend
these
money
and
resource
to
these
places
where
we
can
benefit
from
in
today
's
life
.

hydrogen
fuel
produced
can
be
used
in

as
its
onboard
fuel
.

to
a
large
extent
,
i
agree
that
the
current
development
and
policies
have
helped
to
ease
the
aging
process
.

after
world
war
ii
,
we
saw
a
rapid
increase
in
the
birth
rate
across
the
globe
and
singapore
too
,
faces
the
same
problem
.

the
rfid
supporters
may
argue
that
a
lot
-
protecting
means
are
provides
in
this
case
.

finally
,
all
the
research
and
developments
of
technology
depend
on
economic
factor
.

after
that
,
engineers
have
to
``
gather
pertinent
information
''
to
make
sure
-
that
this
problem
is
real
by
doing
a
survey
on
the
users
so
that
they
will
not
waste
time
designing
something
that
the
market
does
not
need
.

(
kei
2009
)
for
the
government
of
singapore
to
substantiate
our
standings
in
the
financial
markets
of
the
world
,
she
has
to
continue
to
provide
incentives
,
coming
from
the
areas
of
world-class
infrastructures
,
investment
avenues
,
tourism
and
trade
,
those
of
which
require
a
sizeable
amount
of
public
spending
,
-
for
the
experts
in
the
field
to
come
in
.

the
whole
world
would
have
waited
for
more
decades
to
see
the
discovery
of
penicillin
.

as
nuclear
technology
becomes
so
important
,
it
is
necessary
to
have
an
international
organization
to
supervise
the
process
of
every
country
's
-
development
.

it
is
a
time
when
chinese
government
paid
huge
sum
of
money
to
create
good
-
investing
environment
and
financially
support
local
entrepreneurs
.

yet
,
no
actions
have
been
done
by
the
company
to
replace
the
failing
wheels
.

the
number
of
immediate
fatalities
from
1970
to
1992
for
nuclear
-
is
31
and
those
for
coal
and
gases
are
6400
and
1200
respectively
.

from
here
,
we
can
see
that
the
engineering
design
processes
must
be
constantly
be
updated
,
-
otherwise
more
problems
may
occur
and
this
has
caused
many
engineering
design
process
to
be
abandoned
halfway
and
hence
,
it
is
a
problem
that
may
significantly
hamper
engineering
design
process
for
innovations
.

last
but
not
the
least
,
is
the
security
.

consequently
,
generation
iv
nuclear
systems
are
born
,
including
six
models
.

in
the
case
of
iraq
,
satisfying
the
basic
needs
of
-
people
is
the
most
important
thing
which
should
be
put
first
.

as
the
aging
problems
are
getting
seriously
nowadays
,
it
should
not
be
invariably
neglected
by
the
society
but
to
face
the
problem
that
the
elderly
may
suffer
financial
hardships
in
their
golden
age
after
they
-
retired
.

in
my
perspective
,
it
may
not
be
practical
-
especially
for
the
developing
countries
with
large
population
.

for
examples
,
there
are
also
many
-
needy
people
like
orphans
,
the
disabled
or
unemployed
that
want
to
be
subsidized
by
the
government
.

secondly
,
any
supports
of
traditional
power
plants
argue
that
the
cost
of
building
nuclear
plants
is
much
higher
than
for
the
coal
plants
.

on
the
other
hand
,
due
to
the
fast-paced
and
stressful
working
environment
nowadays
,
the
elder
generations
would
not
be
motivated
to
extend
their
stay
in
the
workforce
.

hence
,
we
can
conclude
that
automation
can
be
seen
as
a
tool
in
relieving
the
aging
process
that
can
be
beneficial
in
a
long
run
.

engineers
should
not
have
been
over-expected
;
after
all
,
engineers
are
also
ordinary
people
and
have
limitations
of
human
as
well
.

generation
iv
reactors
may
just
be
the
solution
to
meet
these
demands
.

secondly
,
biological
change
is
another
-
change
that
aging
brings
about
.

however
,
the
rising
standard
of
living
can
cause
some
factors
that
will
contribute
to
the
aging
population
such
as
high-quality
health
care
,
which
helps
people
live
longer
.

instead
,
it
is
a
must
for
him
to
disclose
his
disease
to
:
his
spouse
to
save
their
baby
from
inheriting
the
disease
,
-
his
employer
to
make
sure
that
his
job
is
safe
and
-
all
people
around
him
-
.

due
to
the
above
two
problems
,
chinese
engineering
design
was
harmed
seriously
.

there
is
a
need
for
this
development
as
currently
nuclear
reactors
are
not
that
safe
and
efficient
.

furthermore
,
besides
ensuring
that
the
elderly
will
have
sufficient
funds
for
their
living
expenses
after
their
retirement
,
the
singapore
government
has
also
ensured
that
the
elderly
will
be
able
to
cope
with
the
hefty
and
long
term
medical
expenses
in
their
old
age
through
the
implementation
of
policies
such
as
the
eldershield
(
healthcare
financing
,
eldershield
)
.

therefore
the
current
problem
singapore
-
facing
now
is
the
aged
population
.

without
proper
knowledge
and
problem-solving
skills
from
psychology
design
,
they
could
not
know
exactly
the
situation
and
behaved
in
a
wrong
way
when
problems
appeared
.

car
manufacturers
are
the
next
immediate
culprit
culpable
for
the
continued
devlopment
of
gasoline-powered
vehicles
-
rather
than
focusing
on
the
environmental
friendly
electric
car
.

first
of
all
,
engineering
processes
provides
the
foundation
for
researches
to
get
a
new
state-of-the-art
design
.

they
have
higher
quantity
of
combustion
,
but
they
are
not
reproducible
and
the
resource
is
limited
.

it
should
,
however
,
be
emphasized
that
the
governments
do
pay
attention
to
the
aged
population
and
what
mentioned
here
is
limiting
the
spending
on
this
matter
in
a
reasonable
way
.

however
,
this
is
not
always
true
because
technology
can
overcome
some
obstacles
that
they
faced
during
the
aging
process
.

for
a
country
-
spending
in
education
is
consider
as
injecting
-
into
an
economy
-
whereas
spending
on
the
aged
is
consider
as
-
a
leakage
in
an
economy
.

an
area
where
psychology
can
be
applied
is
interpersonal
communication
which
is
required
in
the
processes
of
engineering
.

no
amount
of
them
is
meaningful
.

therefore
,
an
increase
in
social
disparity
and
healthcare
problems
would
be
an
issue
to
the
country
.

however
,
one
could
question
why
did
the
terrorists
not
fly
the
plane
into
the
twin
reactors
?

only
if
the
key
players
,
engineers
,
are
-
concerned
and
given
due
attention
can
the
world
of
engineering
run
in
the
right
direction
.

therefore
,
if
they
are
in
need
of
help
,
why
not
just
help
them
?

its
success
is
determined
mainly
by
three
factors
:
company
's
perception
towards
the
product
,
economic
factor
and
social
factor
.

thus
,
the
public
expenditure
of
on
education
should
never
be
overlooked
.

hence
,
as
-
bike

is
a
bluetooth
headset
gadget
,
i
predict
a
not
so
bright
future
for
its
sales
record
.

nuclear-related
issue
has
always
been
one
of
the
most
important
issues
of
the
contemporary
system
of
justice
.

if
an
individual
discover
after
a
genetic
test
that
he
has
a
high
risk
of
developing
certain
disease
,
it
would
mean
that
his
family
member
who
share
similar
genes
may
be
at
risk
as
well
(
forrest
k
,
2003
)
.

advocates
of
rfid
argue
that
the
technology
will
prevent
terrorist
from
entering
the
nation
by
reducing
forgery
of
passport
(
us
department
of
homeland
security
)
.

firstly
,
the
majority
of
the
elderly
population
are
often
outdated
with
the
newer
technologies
,
most
of
them
are
unable
to
handle
modern
gadgets
.

it
is
also
intensively
consumer
focused
and
very
flexible
,
able
to
adapting
to
the
needs
and
demands
of
internet
users
quickly
.

for
example
,
five
percent
of
the
population
in
singapore
is
1000
times
lesser
than
five
percent
of
the
population
in
the
china
.

with
the
elderly
returning
to
the
workforce
they
will
be
able
to
accumulate
more
wealth
and
save
more
so
that
they
will
be
able
to
be
self
sufficient
when
they
are
older
.

in
the
long
run
,
we
are
still
maintaining
our
level
of
elderly
care
thought
a
different
way
.

by
using
the
most
advanced
batteries
,
a
fully
charged
electric
car
can
run
about
160km
(
first
business
daily
)
.

engineers
have
faces
with
various
challenges
to
design
medical
devices
which
are
safe
,
efficient
,
accurate
,
serviceable
,
user
friendly
,
manageable
,
durable
and
environmental
compatible
.

an
engineer
would
firstly
need
to
define
the
problem
.

as
a
result
we
do
not
have
the
first
mover
advantage
.

to
ensure
that
there
are
sufficient
funds
for
the
country
's
development
,
public
spending
on
the
age
should
be
limited
.

during
the
singapore
national
day
rally
,
prime
minster
lim
hsien
loong
pointed
out
the
need
to
improve
the
health
care
system
for
the
aged
.

making
matters
worse
,
if
the
retirement
costs
and
providing
for
aged
parents
are
added
into
the
equation
,
having
children
will
be
the
last
thing
on
the
couples
'
minds
.

in
general
,
the
justification
of
the
utility
of
a
specific
technology
or
invention
depends
on
the
specific
perspectives
from
different
group
of
people
.

safety
issues
involving
past
nuclear
accidents
still
strikes
fear
in
the
public
's
heart
.

furthermore
,
the
nutrition
industry
has
also
jumped
in
this
battle
against
-
aging
problem
with
milk
and
other
products
like
quintessence
that
can
help
the
aged
from
the
depression
of
bone
strength
and
the
cells
of
the
heart
from
damage
like
that
benefit
of
milk
thistle
and
many
more
.

as
-
large
working
population
retires
,
this
will
mean
that
there
are
less
people
to
work
and
provide
for
the
retired
elderly
.

indeed
,
the
above
issue
warrants
a
substantial
amount
of
concern
.

this
is
costly
and
also
gives
manageable
weapons
grade
plutonium
as
an
outcome
,
which
is
not
desired
.

they
cited
that
a
number
of
laws
have
been
enacted
to
prohibit
insurance
companies
from
collecting
information
of
genetic
testing
and
using
them
to
discriminate
against
people
(
maxwell
&
mehlman
1999
)
.

firstly
,
by
making
sure
that
the
house
has
single
level
living
-
,
-
no
steps
in
main
entries
,
no
obstruction
in
the
hall
way
and
bedrooms
open
to
the
sitting
room
can
reduce
the
accidents
at
home
for
the
elderly
.

eccs
can
remove
excess
heat
and
avoid
damage
to
power
plant
in
emergency
cases
,
such
as
terrorism
.

opponents
of
surveillance
technology
argue
that
surveillance
technology
invades
privacy
.

since
it
is
much
more
expensive
than
-
usually
used
firepower
plant
,
whether
nuclear
power
plant
can
provide
electricity
efficiently
with
a
reasonable
cost
became
a
rather
essential
problem
.

therefore
,
to
prevent
over
dependence
on
the
government
by
the
children
,
public
spending
should
be
limited
and
be
diverted
to
other
areas
for
better
use
.

at
the
same
time
,
the
technology
to
dig
on
the
moon
,
and
even
use
helium
as
a
fuel
is
still
not
available
yet
.

though
some
may
agree
that
public
spending
on
the
aged
largely
aids
the
society
in
coping
with
the
needs
of
an
ageing
population
,
however
,
it
may
-
hinders
the
development
in
other
sectors
.

before
a
technology
innovation
is
developed
and
patented
,
scientists
have
to
go
through
a
tedious
research
process
most
of
the
time
.

the
government
has
highlighted
to
the
public
the
importance
and
benefits
of
financial
planning
for
their
old
age
.

though
the
use
of
rfid
technology
has
its
merits
such
as
crime
prevention
,
it
should
still
be
barred
because
the
use
of
surveillance
technology
such
as
rfid
to
track
people
not
only
infiltrate
one
's
privacy
;
it
is
also
not
cost
effective
and
likely
to
result
in
data
theft
and
data
loss
.

however
,
large
scale
setup
of
barriers
and
tuxedos
lookalike
safety
suit
might
not
be
feasible
as
they
increases
the
cost
significantly
and
limits
its
actual
functionality
.

they
also
do
not
care
whether
this
-
knowledge
is
right
or
wrong
.

however
,
there
are
arguments
that
are
against
the
use
of
rfid
technology
in
monitoring
and
tracking
people
and
animals
despite
the
benefits
gained
.

individual
that
may
inherit
genetically
disease
should
-
choose
job
that
are
beyond
their
reach
.

thus
,
rfid
can
be
use
to
track
a
child
as
it
can
prevent
kidnapping
.

just
what
is
surveillance
technology
?

so
,
my
stand
as
a
reviewer
is
that
tata
's
nano
lacks
safety
.

on
the
contrary
,
excessive
public
spending
can
also
-
hinder
the
development
of
a
country
too
.

this
could
be
explained
because
in
order
to
determine
the
most
possible
solution
in
engineering
design
process
,
we
have
to
conduct
many
experiments
and
these
experiments
require
materials
in
which
money
must
be
injected
into
the
project
.

their
efforts
should
be
compensated
when
they
are
old
by
providing
-
suitable
assistance
scheme
through
public
spending

tracing
back
to
the
late
1970s
,
electronic
data
interchange
and
electronic
funds
transfer
first
emerged
in
the
us
to
satisfy
people
's
needs
for
simple
business
communication
.

defining
it
would
include
a
refining
of
the
question
at
hand
to
a
more
straight
forward
one
.

if
we
fail
to
limit
the
public
spending
on
the
aged
,
the
pressure
is
likely
to
have
an
effect
on
public
spending
for
other
priorities
,
and
also
affect
economic
growth
.

there
are
other
contributing
factors
such
as
the
efforts
of
the
inventors
and
their
determinations
to
succeed
that
lead
to
the
discovery
of
the
technology
.

in
all
,
with
the
help
of
advancing
technologies
,
the
elderly
can
counter
their
shortfalls
in
sight
and
hearing
loss
and
thus
still
live
independently
without
much
intervention
from
family
members
or
others
,
especially
when
there
is
nobody
at
home
.

for
example
,
when
somebody
or
some
companies
want
to
apply
new
techniques
into
practice
,
in
some
certain
situations
,
they
had
to
ask
the
government
for
permissions
.

in
addition
,
the
additional
healthcare
resource
can
improve
the
health
of
the
elderly
hence
,
enhancing
the
productivity
of
the
aged
.

there
is
not
much
more
that
the
government
need
to
spend
on
developing
the
nation
.

there
are
technologies
whereby
they
can
enable
the
elderly
to
look
younger
.

in
-
long
run
,
it
will
stimulate
economic
.

providing
better
healthcare
and
welfare
services
has
been
regarded
more
important
than
before
due
to
the
ageing
population
we
are
facing
today
.

that
is
why
-
building
more
underground
level
,
we
need
to
use
-
khandani
principle

,
that
is
require
engineer
to
gather
a
lot
of
pertinent
information
from
any
sources
available
before
implement
it
.

with
a
carefully
constructed
policy
,
government
agencies
get
to
develop
a
holistic
approach
that
meets
the
needs
of
the
elderly
.

granted
,
we
can
not
deny
the
impact
of
them
,
such
as
-
chernobyl
and
three
mile
island
accidents
,
-
the
new
technology
can
eliminate
the
possibility
of
these
accidents
.

in
addition
,
a
substantial

from

be
awarded

is
to
encounter
any
mishap

which
results
in

undergoing
this
challenge
,
vietnam
will
gain
more
power
to
catch
up
with
the
developed
world
.

as
a
result
,
these
ongoing
efforts
to
invest
and
develop
the
nation
benefits
the
future
generations
of
all
ages
.

this
is
to
ensure
``
improved
continuity
and
coordination
of
care
''
(

and
reduce
the
probabilities
in
``

''
(

.

however
,
due
to
practical
reasons
,
spendings
have
to
be
limited
.

this
is
also
a
human
rights
issue
as
it
has
invades
a
person
-
privacy
(
bogonikolos
,
1999
)
.

therefore
,
the
engineers
came
out
with
a
similar
design
as
what
the
trams
are
using
which
is
used
to
solve
the
vibration
issue

this
essay

for
most
people
,
bearing
in
mind
that
they
will
have
to
take
care
more
for
themselves
when
they
are
old
will
force
them
to
save
money
for
the
future
.

all
three
areas
of
education
,
healthcare
and
social
policy
are
equally
important
whereby
unnecessary
funding
to
other
sectors
,
like
to
the
military
,
can
well
be
avoided
or
reduced
.

government
should
provide
stable
surroundings
for
farmers
to
plant

countries
with
a
lot
of
inhospitable
space
need
not
only
to
achieve
a
better
space
usage
,
but
also
to
reforms
the
land
to
make
it
livable
and
technology
can
help
it
in
a
number
of
ways
depending
on
the
trouble
the
lands
have
.

there
is
no
advantage
whatsoever
for
either
technologies
.

however
,
these
nuclear
reactors
also
have
their
own
disadvantages
such
as
producing
radioactive
wastes
,
high
cost
and
safety
issues
.

maybe
it
takes
about
a
few
years
to
generate
a
new
generation
.

nevertheless
,
insurance
companies
judge
clients
on
the
testing
result
and
either
refuse
the
healthcare
coverage
or
even
transfer
this
suspect
diagnosis
to
the
next
generation

(

.

similarly
,
if
the
disease
is
untreatable
,
the
family
member
could
make
-
decision
to
terminate
the
child
so
that
the
disease
will
not
affect
the
next
generation
.

at
the
same
time
,
problems
related
to
aging
population
have
arisen
and
more
will
start
to
surface
as
time
passed
and
this
has
raised
-
concerns
of
the
world
.

thanks
to
the
technology
of

these

therefore
,
if
-
device
can
avoid
wasting
water
in
-
daily
life
of
each
person
,
it
will
surely
save
-
considerably
large
amount
of
water
.

for
instance
,
one
of
the
most
tragic
accidents
involving
radiation
release
was
the
chernobyl
disaster
,
which
happened
in
1986
.

this
is
why
we
are
able
to
see
the
presence/existence
of

the

money
could
be
diverted
to
tourism
and
military
-
,
for
instance
,
as
these
may
be
other
crucial
areas
of
a
country
's
development
that
requires
public
spending
.

hence
,
more
and
more
people
are
suggesting
diverting
the
money
to
other
areas
of
development
,
which
they
think
is
beneficial
to
them
as
compare
to
spending
on
the
aged
.

however
,
the
productivity
level
remains
the
same
but
still
meet
its
objective
.

from
the
original
design
that
requires
manual
operation
by
turning
the
wheels
with
hands
to
the
wheelchair
that
can
be
moved

a
single
button
,
the
wheelchair
has
undergone
many
changes
.

it
is
an
organization
formed
by
9
leading
countries
in
the

which
consists
of
canada
,
china
,
euratom
,
france
,
japan
,
republic
of
korea
,
south
africa
,
switzerland
,
and
united
states
.

with
the
power
-
of
knowledge
and
advance
technology
,
the
nation
can
improve
its
economy
and
ensure
the
well-being
of
current
and
future
generations
of
older
people
is
taken
care
of
.

this
new
imaging
technology
must
have
both
the
advantages
of
the
non-invasive
and
invasive
imaging
.

in
my
opinion
,
the
right
of
his
or
her
relatives
to
know
the
risk
and
possibility
to
save
lives
should
not
be
denied
by
the
person
.

another
important
advantage
of
msr
s
is
that
they
can
be
built
in
-
small
scale
first
and
can
then
be
expanded
gradually
,
so
the
plants
could
be
easily
built
with
several
small
reactors
and
from
the
income
they
can
carry
out
expansions

economy
.

space
technology
is
a
kind
of
high
innovative
,
high
compositive
and
also
high
cost
technology
.

therefore
,
concentrating
on
prior
areas
of
the
country
's
development
instead
of
investing
significant
amount
of
money
in
the
aged
is
likely
to
ensure
better
lives
for
future
groups
of
older
people
.

it
affects
the
analyzing
and
-
test
step
most
seriously
though
it
can
affect
almost
every
step
of
design
work
.

health
care
policies
can
be
found
in
many
developed
countries
in
easing
the
ageing
process
to
a
very
limited
extent
,
because
they
creates
social
burden
and
fail
to
service
minorities
most
of
the
time
.

critics
at
this
position
may
point
out
that
higher
taxation
rates
will
be
able
to
increase
fiscal
earnings
.

singapore
uses
only
one-fourth
of
-
its
taxes
,
which
is
about
only
$
381
per
capita
on
health
and
individuals
pay
for
the
rest
.

there
is
also
a
need
to
build
elderly
friendly
environment
like
railings
,
lifts
that
goes
to
every
floor
of
the
buildings
,
and
slopes
.

at
the
same
time
,
they
also
assert
that
designs
and
innovations
are
not
their
business
but
things
cared
by
some
leading
firms
in
us
or
other
countries
instead
of
china
whose
enterprise
not
only
lack
of
funds
but
also
core
technology
.

the
idea
of
refrigeration
was
built
based
on
the
principle
that
when
a
liquid
changes
to
a
gas
,
it
absorbs
heat
as
it
expands
in
a
self
contained
cycle
,
the
air
or
other
fluid
surrounding
the
device
can
be
reduced
in
temperature
.

.

to
summarize
,
with
the
current
medical
research
,
development
and
polices
made
by
the
scientists
and
-
government
,
it
have
definitely
slowed
and
eased
the
aging
process
that
everyone
will
experience
.

compared
to
the
structure
of
a
conventional
automobile
,
-
electric
vehicle
has
a
similar
structure
but
different
components
.

the
above
mentioned
facts
state
that
the
newer
technologies
are
much
ahead
of
the
older
ones
.

thus
,
through
advance
research
-
cost
of
nuclear
waste
management
can
be
reduced
and
the
msr
technology
can
be
enhanced
to
further
minimize
the
harmful
effects
and
to
avoid
nuclear
waste
proliferation
.

elderly
people
always
tend
to
depend
a
lot
on
their
children
and
it
results
in
a
strain

relationship
.

much
of
the
limited
fund
should
be
diverted
to
such
projects
which
will
be
successful
in
the
long
run
and

generating

has
selected
six
nuclear
systems

have
the
potential
to
be

in
my
opinion
,
the
supercritical-water-cooled
reactor
(

and
the
very
high
temperature
reactor
(
vhtr
)
are
the
better
ones

of

they
no

worry
the
discrimination
about
any
more
.

besides
,
focus
could
also
be
placed
upon
the
education
for
the
younger
generation
.

for
example
,
britain
spends
more
on
their
ageing
population
as
compared
to
america
and
their
level
of
investment
in
research
and
development
is
lower
than
that
of
america
.

all
the
research
and
funding
for
the
vhtr
is
definitely
worth
the
money
and
effort
with
regards
to
the
security
issue
of
nuclear
power
plant
(

information

.

nevertheless
,
taking
this
situation
from
another
point
of
view
actually
aligns
with
the
government
's
aim
:
fostering
mutual
care
between
the
young
and
elderly
.

the
situation
is
similar
for
the
problem
of
aging
population
.

scientists
from
these
countries
cooperate
to
get
the
development
of
the
next
generation
of
nuclear
technology
,
the
generation
iv
nuclear
reactor
(
world
nuclear
association
,
2008
)
.

the
aged
are
parents
to
our
children
and
we
share
the
roots
of
human
hierarchy
.

in
malaysia
,
the
corruption
in
the
politic
system
has
leads
to
slow
development
in
design
process
.

however
,
there
comes
some
controversies
-
that
the
vhtr
requires
very
complicated
technologies
and
very
high
cost
construction
compared
to
the
sodium
cooled
fast
reactor
.

so
during
the
process
,
they
encounter
different
obstacles
,
such
as
political
issues
,
-
financial
issues
.

however
,
gasoline
vehicles
are
still
higher
in
demand
as
compared
to
non
gas
emission
vehicles
,
electric
vehicles
.

one
of
the
reasons
is
that
normal
employees
are
not
inspirited
to
take
part
in
the
innovation
.

public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
,
which
may
suffer
the
aged
-
but
we
can
not
spend
all
out
-
money
on
the
elderly
,
especially
when
it
will
not
bring
the
long-term
benefit
.

the
retirement
savings
are
important
to
plan
in
advance
for
the
benefits
of
the
elderly
and
they
are
encouraged
to
save
for
the
retirement
savings
,
medical
savings
and
expenses
.

for
most
of
people
,
they
just
worry
about
the
uncertainty
effects
of
gm
food
.

(
nuclear
-
vs.
coal
,
2007
)
the
cost
for
coal
and
nuclear
energies
are
generally
comparative
,
$
300/mw-hr
for
nuclear
energy
and
$
29.1/mw-hr
for
coal
respectively
.

in
summary
,
this
accident
could
have
been
prevented
right
from
the
beginning
,
taking
human
errors
into
considerations
in
the
design
phase
.

public
spending
on
the
aged
should
fluctuate
according
to
the
composition
of
the
old-aged
citizens
within
the
population
of
singapore
.

if
we
do
not
put
enough
effort
to
solve
the
problem
right
now
,
it
will
be
a
really
big
issue
in
the
future
.

the
construction
of
vhtr
is
to
totally
replace
the
conventional
sources
of
energy
in
order
to
benefit
the
human
population
.

government
and
policy
maker
have
to
decide
on
what
is
essential
and
should
be
supported
by
-
public
sector
.

it
is
often
argued
that
the
scwr
is
rather
safe
in
comparison
with
other
generation
iv
reactor
concepts
because
it
operates
at
rather
low
temperature
,
ranging
from
510
to
550°c
(
butler
,
2004
)
.

recently
,
there
have
also
been
top-ups
provided
to
their
cpf
accounts
to
further
help
them
meet
their
retirement
needs
.

thus
,
luck
is
required
at
every
successful
experiment
,
let
alone
serendipity
,
which
requires
more
luck
to
achieve
another
result
to
just
meet
a
certain
kind
of
people
's
need
coincidentally
.

initially
,
blackberry
smartphones
were
introduced
for
occupied
executive
,
politicians
and
lawyers
(
mckenna
,
waldie
,
&
avery
,
2009
)
.

[

according
-
to
one
study
,
20-25
percent
of
the
elderly
in
nursing
homes
are
clinically
depressed
.

but
for
lsd
,
the
physical
and
psychological
effect
varies
greatly
from
one
to
another
,
and
is
highly
depend
on
the
amount
of
dosage
,
consumer
's
personality
,
mood
,
the
surrounding
environment
and
other
variable
factors
.

another
policy
introduced
by
the
singaporean
government
is
to
encourage
-
citizens
to
work
longer
.

on
the
other
hand
,
increasing
-
efficiency
of
current
generators
-
allow
for
optimisation
tune-ups
,
which
are
less
costly
and
more
likely
to
be
welcomed
and
readily
adopted
by
the
energy
business
.

the
process
-
able
to
identify
the
problem
,
understand
why
it
is
still
not
solved
,
produce
solutions
to
it
and
getting
it
work
in
an
engineering
way
.

let
us
have
a
quick
scan
through
one
of
the
world
's
deadliest
high-speed
train
accident-
the
eschede
train
disaster
,
which
hit
a
death
toll
of
101
.

study
has
proved
that
when
employees
feel
they
are
valued
during
a
mission
,
they
tend
to
be
more
responsible
and
as
a
result
,
the
safety
and
quantity
of
production
are
greatly
improved
.

third
,
technological
inventions
provides
help
for
the
aged
who
is
incapable
or
inconvenient
to
walk
on
himself
or
herself
.

however
,
one
might
propose
that
psychology
development
has
brought
about
ageism
,
which
involves
prejudicial
attitudes
to
the
{
aging
process
}

.

they
have
-
solid
foundation
on
math
and
physics
,
they
can
solve
complex
and
difficult
problems
in
short
time
.

this
implemented
policy
highlights
the
importance
of
spending
on
the
aged
to
ensure
that
they
continue
to
contribute
to
the
society
and
lead
a
meaningful
life
.

of
course
,
it
is
not
possible
.

to
sum
up
,
the
spending
on
the
aged
should
not
be
limited
as
it
spurs
economic
growth
and
prepares
the
healthcare
industry
to
combat
this
pressing
issue
.

without
that
-
,
the
elderly
may
start
and
spend
time
reflecting
-
their
past
,
remembering
disappointment
and
that
stage
of
life
may
turn
into
a
time
of
despair
and
loneliness
,
with
only
little
positive
meaning
in
life
.

in
conclusion
,
the
elderly
nowadays
are
being
helped
a
lot
with
different
advances
in
technology
,
-
become
more
and
more
independent
-
to
live
on
their
own
.

the
technological
advancement
in
medical
science
-
will
be
discussed
to
address
some
of
the
issues
mentioned
.

we
may
wonder
why
this
tendency
happens
these
years
.

the
statistics
have
shown
that
in
time
to
come
,
the
problems
of
a
fast
aging
population
will
be
too
overwhelming
for
the
society
to
handle
,
therefore
we
have
to
slow
down
the
aging
process
.

interestingly
,
aid
for
the
aged
in
their
psycho-social
needs
is
still
lacking
.

therefore
,
improvement
in
healthcare
services
for
the
elderly
is
essential
.

although
,
some
technological
problems
still
exist
,
nuclear
power
energy
,
as
one
of
the
further
energy
,
will
surely
get
more
and
more
popular
.

without
the
accession
from
the
society
,
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
emergent
of
any
new
innovations
.

as
for
the
patients
and
the
public
-
their
concerned
is
that
they
need
the
vaccine
to
stay
away
form
the
disease
.

currently
,
the
reactor
is
envisioned
to
have
2
sizes
:
a
small
transportable
system
of
50
to
150
mwe
and
a
medium
system
of
300
to
600
mwe
.

i
personally
support
the
molten
salt
reactor
concept
for
further
research
and
development
based
on
the
following
factors
,
safe
operation
of
the
plant
,
global
security
and
the
cost
efficiency
.

this
award
will
in
turn
help
to
enhance
singapore
hotel
's
positioning
as
a
venue
for
business
travellers
and
mice
events
(
uniquely
singapore
,
2006
)
.

although
almost
everyone
agrees
that
economics
is
the
vital
component
in
the
world
's
life
,
not
many
people
realize
that
it
also
play
an
important
part
in
easing
the
aging
process
.

the
ability
to
communicate
and
sell
an
idea
is
an
critical
skill
in
engineering
design
.

these
breakthroughs
elevate
illnesses
from
the
aged
,
thus
they
can
enjoy
the
remaining
of
their
lives
healthier
,
happier
and
with
less
suffering
.

this
kind
of
need
of
the
combination
of
-
two
technologies
eventually
bring
out
the
camera
phone
.

in
the
case
in
singapore
,
the
increasing
number
of
polyclinics
-
set
up
throughout
the
island
that
resolved
the
long
queues
and
inaccessibility
problem
.

policies
for
employability
and
financial
security
-
like
the
workfare
income
supplement
(
wis
)
scheme
for
the
older
low-wage
workers
-
were
introduced
in
2007
.

the
french
self-breeding
variant
claims
50kg
of
thorium
and
50kg
u-238
per
billion
kwh
.

the
public
are
afraid
that
the
high
-
temperatures
in
the
nuclear
reactors
will
be
a
major
hazard
for
the
people
working
in
and
those
living
near
the
reactors
.

it
detects
bio-signal
on
a
person
's
skin
,
analyzes
the
signal
to
figure
out
the
person
's
movement
and
gives
support
at
proper
place
with
proper
power
.

it
is
no
doubt
that
it
is
extremely
expensive
to
fly
to
the
moon
and
do
the
mining
there
.

they
should
implement
the
solution
of
building
multiple
level
basements
for
multi-unit
housing
and
building
since
we
do
n't
really
use
a
lot
of
the
underground
space
.

if
the
nuclear
reactor
runs
on
-
opened
loop
fuel
system
,
nuclear
waste
will
not
be
recycled
.

he
found
out
that
an
anticoagulation
agent
called
coumarin
is
the
cause
of
death
of
his
cow
when
the
hay
stem
punctured
the
cow
's
stomach
.

the
main
issue
pertaining
to
this
is
that
when
an
individual
choose
not
to
disclose
the
result
of
the
genetic
testing
,
it
is
actually
unfair
to
and
has
adverse
impacts
on
both
his
family
and
-
employer
.

technology

in
return
,
encourages

to
keep

through
a

effective
system
.

hence
,
if
the
health
status
of
the
people
is
very
low
,
investors
may
not
want
to
invest
in
the
country
and
this
may
affect
the
economic
growth
of
the
country
.

adding
on
,
people
today
are
becoming
work-oriented
and
adding
to
the
notion
of
higher
standard
of
living
,
they
tend
to
be
``
afraid
''
of
getting
married
as
they
do
not
want
to
burden
themselves
with
the
expenditures
they
have
to
face
when
having
a
family
.

lastly
,
they
are
concerned
with
the
safety
level
of
the
plant
.

the
engineering
design
recently
has
been
implemented
in
a
lot
of
asia-pacific
countries
,
including
indonesia
.

according
to
the
health
,
united
states
(
2008
)
,
from
1900
through
2005
,
life
expectancy
at
birth
increased
from
46
to
75
years
for
men
and
from
48
to
80
years
for
women
.

like
in
singapore
,
there
are
priority
seats
for
-
elderly
so
that
they
do
not
have
to
stand
for
long
distances
.

about
17
%
of
the
world
's
electricity
came
from
nuclear
plants
.

they
own
a
house
but
do
not
have
sufficient
fund
to
meet
their
basic
needs
in
old
age
(
ministry
,
2006
)
.

despite
all
these
opposing
arguments
,
i
firmly
believe
that
the
practice
of
psychology
is
essential
in
design
processes
to
help
avoid
human
errors
and
prevent
disasters
.

for
example
,
as
mentioned
by
our
prime
minister
lee
hsien
loong
(
national
day
rally
speech
,
2009
)
,
hospitals
like
khoo
teck
puat
hospital
and
jurong
general
hospital
will
be
built
to
meet
the
rising
demand
-
and
at
the
same
time
providing
accessibility
.

vhtr
uses
helium
gas
as
coolant
which
does
not
react
with
other
substance
even
at
-
high
temperatures
(
chang
,
2007
)
.

this
is
so
as
it
will
be
ready
in
the
year
2025
,
five
years
earlier
than
the
msr
.

and
children
can
only
abide
to
the
obligations
if
they
are
financially
stable
.

for
example
,
a
person
who
is
diagnosed
to
have
a
serious
disorder
in
a
gene
,
which
may
lead
to
a
rare
disease
,
will
have
to
think
very
carefully
before
getting
married
since
his
or
her
children
can
also
have
this
disease
also
.

instead
,
funds
could
be
directed
to
the
development
of
-
very
high
temperature
reactor
(
vhtr
)
which
utilizes
helium
which
is
not
important
for
human
survival
as
helium
is
not
found
in
-
human
body
(
the
encyclopedia
of
earth
,
2008
)
.

however
,
self-examine
has
low
accuracy
in
detection
of
breast
cancer
while
other
method
like
mammography
is
only
meant
for
women
who
age
40
years
old
and
above
(
georgiahealthinfo.gov
,
n.d.
)
.

in
conclusion
,
the
used
of
surveillance
technology
should
not
be
banned
as
it
benefits
a
lot
to
us
in
public
security
and
also
-
business
efficiency
.

global
life
expectancy
at
birth
,
which
is
estimated
to
have
risen
from
58
years
in
1970-1975
to
67
years
in
2005-2010
,
is
expected
to
keep
on
rising
to
reach
75
years
in
2045-2050
(
united
nations
,
2007
)
.

this
disaster
raised
great
public
concern
about
the
safety
of
nuclear
power
.

japan
had
started
to
develop
robots
meant
for
elderly
.

in
conclusion
,
due
to
the
serious
impact
in
one
's
life
,
we
should
let
the
individual
to
decide
his
revealing
genetic
results
.

development
in
technological
inventions
has
been
having
a
lot
impacts
on
detecting
and
curing
aging
diseases
.

and
compared
with
very
high
temperature
reactor
,
the
scwr
is
a
breeder
one
,
thus
it
could
produce
more
usable
potentially
usable
fuel
,
which
means
less
core
material
such
as
uranium
would
be
consumed
to
produce
-
same
quantities
of
electricity
.

then
the
process
and
product
would
be
more
environmental
friendly
.

as
far
as
the
radioactive
waste
is
concerned
,
-
lead-cooled
fast
reactor
is
designed
best
to
cut
back
on
the
amount
of
high
level
waste
.

for
most
developed
and
developing
countries
,
healthcare
would
become
an
issue
.

signals
will
be
transmitted
to
the
hospital
to
alert
the
nurses
of
their
condition
.

as
such
,
with
the
different
types
of
facilities
and
medical
developments
available
,
the
elderly
no
longer
has
to
suffer
in
silence
.

in
other
words
,
it
is
highly
friendly
to
the
environment
.

there
are
better
methods
of
using
this
sum
of
money
collected
from
taxes
from
its
people
to
solve
-
waste
disposal
problem
.

these
occurrences
may
seem
common
now
,
but
they
were
definitely
not
in
the
early
1900s
.

this
is
to
ensure
that
the
future
batch
of
elderly
are
well-prepared
for
their
own
ageing
process
and
not
just
wait
for
the
government
to
take
care
of
them
.

this
may
be
true
;
however
,
god
did
n't
give
us
a
perfect
world
.

they
should
also
be
updated
about
any
latest
methods
to
generate
energy
in
environmental
friendly
ways
,
such
as
-
solar
energy
,
tidal
energy
or
wind
energy
,
and
their
respective
advantages
and
drawbacks
.

while
public
spending
on
the
aged
is
vital
,
it
should
not
comprise
the
other
aspects
of
the
country
's
growth
and
development
.

in
conclusion
on
the
whole
,
society
should
now
move
toward
a
new
paradigm
that
aging
does
not
equate
to
burdensome
on
the
economy
or
-
development
of
a
country
.

taking
singapore
as
an
example
,
she
will
be
witnessing
a
drastic
demographic
shift
in
history
,
with
the
age
population
ratio
predicted
to
change
drastically
from
one
in
twelve
residents
-
over
the
age
of
65
in
2005
to
one
in
five
residents
in
2030
(
community
on
ageing
issues
,
2006
)
.

this
is
very
crucial
as
to
ensure
that
the
productivity
and
the
efficiency
of
workers
are
kept
to
a
maximum
.

next
step
will
be
gathering
information
.

this
inevitably
sparks
of
the
arms
race
.

is
privacy
is
more
important
-
the
health
condition
and
welfare
of
your
spouse
and
children

the
result
of
the
genetic
testing
concerns
parties
other
than
the
individual
alone
,
and
therefore
,
the
individual
requesting
for
genetic
testing
should
not
have
the
final
say
to
whether
-
the
results
should
be
revealed
to
others
.

in
terms
of
safety
and
fuel
technologies
used
,
the

stands
in
a

they
should
know
that
they
are
vulnerable
to
the
risk
of

which
can
be
inherited
.

government
should
also
more
encouraging
the
research
and
development
of
these
products
.

then
we
will
decide
which
one
will
better
meet
the
energy
demand
of
the
future

(

cites
that
the
capital
cost
of
building
a
solar
plant
is
25
times
more
than
nuclear
plant
and
the
land
area
-
solar
plant
occupies
is
400
times
more
than
-
nuclear

.

disease
(

,

)
.

with
approaching
this
goal
,
current
research
and
development/
policies
,
to
a
large
extent
,
have
helped
to
ease
the
aging
process
in
different
fields
,
like
psychology
,
medicine
,
etc
.

therefore
,
in
modern
society
,
engineering
has
become
more
important
;
the
role
of
an
engineer
is
to
design
a
safe
and
efficient
product
or
a
system
that
minimizes
the
damages
to
the
environment
or
brings
benefits
to
the
human
kind
.

if
you
think
in
another
way
round
,
the
parent
's
contribution
to
children
may
not
be
lesser
than
children
's
contribution
to
parent
.

in
addition
,
-
government
can
also
invest
in
areas
where
the
profit
and
social
welfare
can
be
improved
so
that
the
citizens
'
standard
of
living
will
be
increased
.

-
kyoto
protocol
signed
in
japan
is
the
best
example
.

in
the
age
of
information
technology
and
globalization
,
the
world
we
live
today
have
progressed
beyond
our
imagination
by
the
aid
of
constant
improvement
in
technology
by
research
and
development
(
r
&
d
)
as
well
as
innovation
.

as
a
result
,
there
is
a
decrease
in
efficiency
as
it
is
being
used
many
times
and
loses
its
capability
to
generate
the
same
amount
of
energy
.

the
use
of
psychology
provides
an
approach
to
open
the
designer
this
'black
box
'
,
or
at
least
fraction
of
the
box
,
so
that
we
can
see
what
goes
on
in
designers
'
heads
,
and
thus
prevent
or
at
least
minimize
the
design
errors
(
wilpert
,
2007
)
.

however
,
we
should
also
keep
in
mind
that
infrastructure
developments
do
not
only
apply
to
improve
the
economy
,
but
also
to
improve
and
bring
convenience
to
the
lives
to
the
people
,
especially
the
aged
.

there
are
a
few
alternate
energy
sources
apart
from
fossil

fuels

the
use
of
surveillance
technology
should
not
be
banned
because
it
is
useful
in
ensuring
the
public
safety
and
monitoring

that
in

,
7.3
%
of
the
population
comprises
of
older
singaporeans
aged
65
and
above
,
and
it
is
expected
that
they
will
make
up
19

the
cost
of
uranium
ore
is
a
very
small
portion
of
the
operating
cost
of
a
nuclear
power
plant
.

the
process
of
inventing
and
innovations
are
crucial
to
all
of
us
.

hence
,
developing
countries
should
first
focus
on
dealing
with
poverty
and
unemployment
before
they
can
shift
the
funds
on
building
new
nuclear
reactors
.

it
met
the
many
challenges
once
faced
by
people
and
safety
is
one
of
the
challenges
faced
.

initially
when
mobile
phones
were
created
,
the
society
's
demand
for
them
was
low
.

nuclear
reactors
use
energy
generated
from
nuclear
fission
which
has
a
very
high
output
to
material
used
ratio
.

due
to
logistic
reason
combined
with
the
unstoppable
depletion
rate
,
scientists
in
the
united
state
is
diverting
most
of
their
funding
into
research
of
how
to
make
nuclear
power
as
a
readily
mobile
and
less
dangerous
energy
source
for
military
uses
.

in
our
daily
lives
,
it
is
true
that
we
may
experience
this
or
that
kind
of
things
,
but
it
is
only
those
careful
ones
,
prepared
ones
,
those
who
always
pay
more
attention
to
tiny
things
happening
around
them
and
treat
-
things
seriously
,
come
up
with
ingenious
discoveries
.

in
attracting
these
foreign
lucrative
industries
,
the
government
build
new
roads
and
infrastructures
to
remain
competitive
globally
.

however
for
someone
,
this
benefit
is
just
the
other
world
's
happy
story
.

if
the
tfr
is
higher
,
there
would
also
be
more
people
to
work
in
the
future
,
-
contributing
more
to
the
economy
and
sustaining
its
high
growth
.

in
what
ways
can
the
health
system
adapts
to
the
needs
of
the
aged
who
have
a
higher
probability
of
having
chronic
diseases
.

this
harsh
behavior
brings
fear
to
adult
who
is
going
to
be
over
the
retirement
age
,
putting
them
into
the
category
of
jobless
elderly
.

a
device
that
free
out
more
available
spaces
is
gaining
more
recognition
.

chernobyl
is
not
the
only
serious
accident
of
nuclear
plant
in
the
past
.

likewise
,
national
policy
has
also
help
to
improve
the
lives
of
the
elderly
.

besides
,
the
current
development
of
solar
battery
is
not
good
enough
to
afford
long-distance
driving
.

a
portion
of
the
money
should
be
diverted
into
the
sectors
which
are
more
important
in
the
long
run
such
as
education
and
r
&
d
.

people
may
take
advantage
of
-
government
subsidies
to
pay
for
the
expensive
new
technologies
which
are
not
necessary
.

although
some
people
still
insist
that
it
is
better
to
let
someone
take
care
of
the
old
or
provide
asylums
for
them
,
and
therefore
there
is
no
need
to
redesign
their
homes
,
they
fail
to
consider
the
fees
for
the
care
and
the
feeling
of
the
old
.

in
this
case
,
i
'm
confident
that
generation
iv
reactors
in
general
and
the
vhtr
concept
in
particular
deserve
to
be
funded
around
the
world
.

therefore
,
more
budget
should
be
channeled
to
the
economic
sector
to
boost
the
country
's
economic
situation
.

according
to
-
psychology
and
design
processes
(
bernhard.w
.

in
-
context
of
singapore
,
the
aged
above
65-years
old
are
projected
to
represent
23
%
of
the
population
by
2030
and
this
would
be
the
second
highest
percentage
in
asia
after
japan
(
wijaya
,
2009
)
.

the
amount
of
time
spent
in
lab
for
practical
is
minimal

in
tennis
and
cricket
,
-
hawk-eye
system
has
become
an
important
reference
for
judgment
and
even
the
decision
maker
when
dispute
come
on
the
scene
.

among
them
are
the
problem
of
plagiarism
and
the
insufficiency
of
fund
support
for
scientific
research
.

whether
the
country
develops
or
not
,
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
not
be
limited
.

when
he
did
some
experiment
focusing
on
radar
waves
,
the
melt
of
a
candy
bar
in
his
pocket
excite
the
surprise
of
him
.

moreover
,
since
such
a
trend
is
only
likely
to
happen
in
the
short
run
,
much
has
been
done
to
buffer
its
negative
impact
on
society
.

the
quality
of
the
laptop
would
-
also
be
much
better
,
as
they
will
have
more
funds
and
more
talented
people
to
develop
the
laptop
.

(

)
if
mizoguchi
had
done
otherwise
,
we
would
probably
have
to
buy
only
toshiba
's
laptop
for
its
convenience
.

it
is
safer
than
vhtr
as
it
has
better
safety
standard
.

furthermore
,
limiting
public
spending
may
cause
the
complaints
of
the
public
and
increase
the
load
on
the
younger
generation
.

moreover
,
tracking
devices
-
are
able
to
assist
law
enforcement
personnel
to
monitor
suspects
closely
(
michael
,
k
&
rose
,

)
.

thus
,
rfid
should
not
be
used
to
track
on
people
.

in
the
1950s
,
not
only
watson
and
crick
,
but
also
two
other
groups
-
were
working
on
the
research
wanting
to
determine
the
structure
of
dna
,
but
in
the
end
,
only
watson
and
crick
were
able
to
produce
good
quality
diffraction
patterns
and
thus
produce
sufficient
quantitative
data
about
the
structure
(
``
history
of
molecular
''
,
2009
)
.

if
a
limit
is
not
in
place
,
the
government
might
soon
face
difficulties
with
funding
other
key
sectors
of
the
country
's
development
such
as
education
and
defense
.

however
,
with
increasing
demands
for
energy
due
to
industrialization
and
the
rising
price
of
oil
and
fossil
fuels
,
nuclear
energy
remains
as
an
important
source
of
energy
despite
all
the
controversies
.

it
may
be
objected
that
despite
great
accommodation
,
there
may
be
some
elders
who
have
not
contributed
to
the
society
at
all
and
worse
so
they
took
advantages
of
the
provisions
given
to
them
.

just
like
the
team
of
design
macintosh
,
they
were
working
day
and
night
under
the
aggressive
leadership
of
steven
jobs
.

to
ensure
an
enough
energy
supply
has
become
an
urgent
current
human
need
than
ever
before
.

as
the
application
of
surveillance
technology
such
as
rfid
-
becoming
more
common
and
widespread
,
the
community
-
raised
an
issue
of
tracking
people
using
these
surveillance
technologies
will
harm
human
rights
.

as
we
all
know
,
the
reactor
fuel
is
possess
of
small
in
size
while
large
in
energy
output
.

according
to
russell
(
june
2008
)
,
the
price
of
one
unit
is
estimated
to
be
us
$
12
billion
.

while
opponents
of
rfid
suggest
that
the
use
of
rfid
bring
benefits
such
as
convenience
and
protection
to
patients
and
children
,
others
view
it
as
a
form
of
security
threat
and
intrusion
of
privacy
(

.

if
there
was
ever
a
need
for
more
funds
to
be
injected
to
the
development
of
the
country
,
other
areas
and
not
the
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
looked
at
.

in
conclusion
,
i
think
that
many
developments
and
policies
have
helped
to
reduce
the
aging
process
and
also
solving
the
problem
of
a
fast
aging
population
.

(

then
,
there
are
individuals
who
abuse
the
usage
of
surveillance
technology
by
sending
their
partner
a
gift
with
rfid
attached
to
it
so
that
they
will
be
able
to
track
the
location
of
their
partner
and
know
who
they
are
hanging
out
with
.

although
the
team
survived
due
to
the
-
insistence
of
mizogushi
and
finally
came
up
with
the
first
laptop
in
the
world
,
lack
of
resources
has
had
an
impact
on
the
design
team
,
which
made
the
team
'stressful
'
(
rogers
,
2003
)
in
the
designing
process
.

assuming
the
same
level

the
usage
of
cognitive
-
would
enhance
the
style
of
thinking
and
creativity
in
the
design
process
,
encouraging
the
engineers
to
come
up
with
an
effective
and
safe
design
.

currently
,
-
people
realise
the
features
of
environmental
protection
and
the
economical
efficiency
of
the
solar
energy
;
the
use
of
solar
energy
is
made
use
of
more
and
more
widespread
in
the
ordinary
life
.

the
electronic
dictronary
with
an
outstanding
look
allows
students
to
show
off
around
their
fellows
.

from
my
perspective
,
economic
development
is
not
only
the
key
factor
-
easing
the
aging
-
but
also
is
the
key
solution
for
some
serious
problems
caused
by
this
process
.

however
,
if
the
result
of
the
test
can
be
easily
access
by
-
third
party
,
a
lot
of
problems
will
be
occurred
.

however
in
vhtr
,
plutonium

spiked
with
heat

and
radioactive
elements
(
butler

.

today
,
with
constant
breakthrough
in
medical
research
and
development
as
well
as
reassessment
in
the
social
policies
,
the
aging
process
has
been
eased
for
many
.

as
an
alternative
,
some
of
the
policies
should
be
reformed
to
shift
a
part
of
the
government
duty
to
the
family
of
the
elders
,
and
even
the
elders
themselves
.

for
example
,
doing
traffic
counts
,
area-wide
surveys
,
parking
surveys
,
identify
speeding
rates
of
-
vehicles
,
analysing
the
queue
length
and
the
junction
delays
could
be
part
of
the
studies
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
the
problem
.

what
is
worse
,
there
are
many
companies
which
even
do
not
get
a
r
&
d
team
yet
.

however
,
the
opponents
of
this
position
argue
that
the
elderly
may
has
a
lot
of
experience
,
and
then
they
are
very
important
.

public
spending
on
the
aged
should
not
be
limited
as
the
aging
population
is
not
one
to
be
looked
down
upon
,
-
however
,
the
other
areas
of
development
should
not
be
neglected
.

they
have
been
made
more
efficiently
and
better
to
human
with
a
design
process
.

he
organized
a
group
of
talented
engineers
who
were
selected
from
the
military
projects
with
strong
professional
skills
and
knowledge
and
started
the
research
secretly
.

the
government
's
coffer
is
not
a
ceaseless
goldmine
and
if
public
spending
for
the
aged
is
not
bring
under
control
,
it
will
eventually
run
out
-
which
in
turn
will
affect
future
generations
when
they
become
the
aged
.

aged
people
may
-
unable
to
seek
for
medical
assistance
when
they
suffer
from
sickness
such
as
heart
attack
,
high
blood
pressure
and
etc
.

intyre
(
1977
)
once
said
that
old
age
throughout
this
century
has
been
seen
as
a
'social
problem
'
and
this
is
true
when
the
government
started
off
with
all
kinds
of
policies
to
ease
this
matter
.

however
,
in
the
current
situation
where
there
are
no
better
alternatives
,
nuclear
energy
seems
to
be
the
most
suitable
energy
for
the
future
and
therefore
one
of
the
generation
iv
reactors
,
-
lead-coaled
fast
reactor
,
should
be
adopted
as
the
most
suitable
one
.

the
building
showed
signs
of
failure
in
the
structural
integrity
16
hours
well
before
the
collapsed
,
yet
people
who
witnessed
the
failure
did
not
react
appropriately
,
staff
of
the
building
was
alerted
but
did
not
know
what
to
expect
,
whereas
the
management
overlooked
and
had
repair
workers
to
fix
the
cracks
in
concrete
by
bracing
it
with
timber
.

rfid
tags
and
cards
can
be
easily
hacked
and
cloned
and
used
immediately
to
get
past
what
we
presumed
to
be
secured
(
jones
,
2008
)
.

there
are
many
different
medical
research
is
where
engineers
could
lay
their
hand
on
and
design
products
according
-
the
requirement
.

before
going
into
further
investigation
,
it
is
important
to
bear
this
in
mind
that
aging
process
is
not
as
simple
as
longevity
,
but
associated
with
one
's
ability
to
contribute
to
the
society
and
participate
in
various
social
activities
.

despite
the
fact
that
many
people
approve
the
idea
of
unlimited
budget
for
the
old
,
it
would
be
better
to
set
a
term
to
-
governments
'
expenses
in
this
problem
for
some
reasons
.

long
term
illness
such
as
diabetes
is
more
effectively
controlled
,
and
the
treatment
process
has
become
less
painful
.

these
questions
proved
to
be
contentious
and
controversial
and
i
will
be
further
expanding
these
ideas
through
this
paper
.

with
an
increase
in
the
fertility
rate
accompanied
with
an
increase
in
the
life
expectancy
of
the
population
,
singapore
was
soon
faced
with
an
overcrowded
population
.

its
options
are
limitless
as
to
regenerate
skin
,
muscle
tissue
,
lost
eye
etc
and
also
to
help
delay
organ
breakdown
,
if
successful
.

we
do
not
have
the
advanced
equipment
and
do
not
use
stabilizing
agent
and
additive
properly
.

we
also
need
to
make
a
complete
market
survey
on
the
reasons
why
hybrid
cars
are
not
getting
the
attention
of
consumers
.

not
only
is
singapore
,
organizations
in
other
countries
too
met
with
many
significant
difficulties
during
their
innovation
designing
process
.

as
we
know
,
the
ability
to
have
chronically
ill
patients
need
to
check
in
with
a
health-care
provider
every
day
and
answer
questions
about
their
current
symptoms
allows
for
immediate
intervention
.

moreover
,
nuclear
power
system
is
much
-
more
secure
than
other
energy
resource
systems
.

time
is
running
out
and
to
protect
the
sustainability
of
life
on
earth
,
necessary
actions
have
to
be
taken
immediately
-
if
not
,
as
soon
as
possible
-
and
the
help
of
engineering
design
processes
should
not
be
left
out
.

in
addition
,
the
limitation
of
electronic
dictronary
,
such
as
no
access
to
the
the
internet
,
also
determines
that
the
price
of
electronic
dictronary
-
can
not
be
too
high
.

another
significant
performance
of
the
very
high
temperature
is
that
it
can
generate
hydrogen
from
water
,
which
can
be
used
in
seawater
desalination
.

many
may
argue
that
the
elderly
are
also
equally
,
if
not
,
more
in
need
of
the
funds
,
especially
since
they
were
once
economically
active
,
it
's
only
right
that
their
welfare
is
being
taken
care
off
now
that
they
have
lost
the
ability
to
take
care
of
themselves
.

the
common
challenges
faced
by
every
developed
and
developing
countries
are
the
daily
demands
for
improvement
in
various
areas
,
be
it
economy
,
infrastructure
or
even
society
.

therefore
,
the
use
of
surveillance
technology
such
as
rfid
to
track
people
should
be
banned
as
it
threatens
the
welfare
of
individuals
.

since
the
cost
of
fossil
fuel
is
soaring
high
now
,
if
we
still
continue
to
use
them
,
we
would
have
to
pay
a
very
high
electricity
cost
when
compared
to
-
nuclear
energy
.

in
conclusion
,
the
vhtr
is
still
one
of
the
better
choices
when
compared
to
the
msr
.

the
problem
starts
form
here
.

building
of
additional
housing
and
infrastructures
would
cost
a
huge
amount
of
money
.

however
,
in
term
of
the
overall
development
cost
,
the
very
high
temperature
reactors
is
still
much
cheaper
than
the
molten
salt
reactor
.

the
use
of
high
temperature
creates
an
extremely
volatile
and
sensitive
situation
which
-
on
-
one
hand
raises
output
efficiency
(
oecd
nuclear
energy
agency
,
2000
)
,
but
also
requires
a
precise
state-of-the-art
monitoring
system
that
further
increases
the
production
prices
.

this
issue
has
led
to
a
heated
debate
on
whether
we
should
limit
the
spending
of
public
funds
on
the
aged
.

however
,
such
decisions
only
have
short-term
benefits
and
fail
to
consider
the
bigger
picture
such
as
situations
-
which
one
's
family
eventually
discovers
one
's
secret
.

(
tilkki

:
a
survey
on
international
state
of
research

2006
,

)
-
all
the
simple
design
reduced
the
construction
cost
of
nuclear
electrical
station
.

these
people
are
encouraged
to
sublet
their
house
or
to
downsize
to
a
more
affordable
one
.

nuclear
power
plants
maybe
hazardous
,
but
the
new
sfr
boosts
many
new
safeguards
.

therefore
,
in
order
to
lower
the
cost
of
production
of
solar
cars
,
development
of
new
materials
is
crucial
.

the
situation
is
further
worsened
for
a
segment
of
the
elderly
in
the
society
who
is
unmarried
and
inadequately
educated
.

use
of

in

is
also
necessary
in

the
possible
dilemma
faced

end
users
using

and
the
possibility
of
wrong
usage
which
can
cause
potential
harm
.

however
,
during
that
time
the
-
nuclear

were
not
well
developed
.

government
can
limit
the
expenditure
because
the
burden
of
health
cost
can
be
borne
by
their
family
members
-
through
scheme
like
medisave
.

,
we
must
thank
edison

and
percy
lebaron
spencer
made
these
two
extraordinary
inventions
.

chips
:
high-tech
aids
or
tools
for
big
brother
?

however
,
in
my
opinion
,
one
of
the
main
concerns
in
our
society
is
finding
a
new
energy
supply
to
alter
the
old
ones
,
which
become
exhausted
due
to
the
overexploitation
of
human
.

moreover
,
they
also
argue
that
governments
'
approach
is
not
a
good
remedy
to
cope
with
the
aging
problem
permanently
.

starting
from
a
tender
age
,
we
should
no
longer
rely
on
parents
to
inculcate
the
youth
on
what
they
deem
as
unimportant
issues
.

hence
,
countries
should
limit
their
spending
on
health
care
to
invest
in
other
potential
opportunities
.

therefore
,
leaders
of
today
must
design
a
desirable
socioeconomic
structure
under
the
pressure
of
an
ageing
population
and
environment
constraints
by
identifying
the
necessary
policy
tools
to
attain
stable
and
sustainable
growth
before
taking
any
effective
actions
.

there
are
many
implications
to
this
issue
and
one
of
such
implication
is
that
the
spending
by
the
government
on
the
aged
has
increased
in
order
to
deal
with
this
issue
.

this
however
do
not
mean
that
the
system
of
surveillance
should
be
banned
but
rather
this
is
where
flaws
of
the
systems
are
examined
to
come
up
with
a
more
fool-proof
system
where
such
-
terrorist
can
not
make
use
of
the
loop
holes
of
the
system
to
escape
.

thus
,
it
should
be
banned
.

it
was
viewed
as
the
most
important
need
among
-
others
.

because
,
on
a
sound
powered
phone
system
,
only
one
person
can
speak
at
a
time
or
the
signal
will
become
hopelessly
garbled
,
however
,
a
mobile
phone
-
system
allows
both
sides
to
input
analog
signals
into
the
circuits
at
the
same
time
.

another
difficulty
involves
disclosure
of
genetic
information
to
insurance
companies
.

sense
of
isolation
and
loneliness
among
homebound
and
single
elderly
might
result
in
mental
illness
and
social
problems
.

in
conclusion
,
engineering
design
processes
can
meet
the
need
of
solving
global
warming
by
the
improvement
of
catalytic
converter
and
execution
of
cautious
planning
before
any
other
procedures
.

additions
to
that
,
the
work
of
medical
scientists
also
reduce
pain
to
-
great
extent
.

chinese
educationalists
have
noticed
this
problem
.

by
2025
this
ratio
is
forecast
to
be
0.59
people
under
20
for
every
person
older
than
65
``
...
we
can
observe
that
the
dramatically
increasing
proportion
of
elderly
will
have
tremendously
wide
impacts
on
our
society
.

the
most
important
three
features
in
the
engineering
design
process
will
cater
to
the
need
to
form
a
new
traffic
system
.

references

moreover
,
with
the
growing
number
of
well-educated
people
around
,
there
is
a
high
probability
that
people
do
purchase
private
insurance
to
care
for
their
own
well-being
.

furthermore
,
non-traditional
renewable
energy
such
as
hydrogen
fuel
and
biodiesel
are
studied
by
engineering
researchers
and
they
may
be
put
into
practice
for
real
industries
someday
in
the
future
.

there
is
an
article
by
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
mentioned
``
the
system
costs
hospitals
about
$
1.6
million
and
requires
an
annual
$
100,000
maintenance
contract
,
according
to
dr
.

there
are
-
some
prototypes
running
on
the
road
.

as
a
result
,
without
promoting
and
inculcating
the
significance
of
being
creative
,
engineering
design
processes
are
hampered
at
the
beginning
stage
.

it
is
predicted
by
experts
that
the
fossil
fuels
will
run
out
in
250-300
years
with
oil
disappearing
in
less
than
100
years
.

secondly
,
the
information
gathered
through
rfid
can
be
used
in
a
way
that
can
endanger
the
life
of
the
individual
itself
(
caspian
,
2003
)
.

thus
-
individual
of
known
genetic
risk
should
be
obligated
to
reveal
test
results
to
relatives
because
it
brings
awareness
concerning
the
risk
of
inheriting
the
disease
to
the
foreground
,
not
only
to
the
person
tested
,
but
for
his
or
her
relatives
as
well
.

the
following
ideas
are
what
i
speculate
on
transferring
in
the
future
:
the
first
step
is
to
store
the
information
of
the
people
,
more
generally
,
is
to
break
up
-
human
body
into
atom-size
particles
and
make
a
rearrangement
of
-
particles
.

from
kitchen
appliances
like
refrigerator
to
home
entertainment
systems
,
these
are
things
which
we
often
take
them
for
granted
.

the
serendipitous
discovery
of
new
ideas
therefore
,
sometimes
comes
out
during
the
trials
.

in
addition
to
the
improvement
of
facilities
in
the
current
agriculture
system
,
high-tech
support
also
plays
a
crucial
role
in
increasing
food
production
.

first
is
the
choice
for
the
coolant
.

it
will
only
create
a
reliance
on
the
government
.

however
,
the
use
of
hydrogen
tanks
in
vehicles
,
and
in
particular
the
challenge
of
using
very
high
pressures
,
require
advanced
technology
.

to
prevent
the
disruption
of
-
labour
market
,
-
elderly
are
likely
to
remain
in
the
work
force
in
the
near
future
.

limiting
public
-
is
something
which
the
governments
must
consider
seriously
.

fortunately
,
mizoguchi
's
product
caught
the
eyes
of
the
senior
vice
president
of
-
toshiba
europe
and
thus
he
offered
to
sell
ten
thousand
laptops
in
a
year
.

to
sum
up
,
surveillance
technology
should
not
be
banned
as
its
usefulness
in
-
workplace
and
enhancing
public
safety
makes
it
an
indispensable
tool
in
today
's
world
.

(
wikipedia
)
even
though
water
seemed
to
be
everywhere
,
only
a
very
small
percentage
of
water
is
drinkable
to
the
global
population
.

in
recent
time
,
terrorists
have
accessed
to
sophisticated
technologies
that
could
create
greater
destruction
to
the
surrounding
and
-
to
instil
fear
in
the
people
.

there
are
some
current
solutions
available
such
as
;
primary
regulations
,
control
devices
,
increased
fuel
efficiency
.

although
we
are
not
sure
what
kind
of
materials
and
technologies
vinci
was
trying
to
use
when
constructing
his
``
tank
''
,
we
are
still
astonished
by
his
ingenious
imagination
.

it
is
also
suggested
that
the
harsh
truth
of
inheriting
a
genetic
risk
may
create
an
emotional
impact
,
especially
when
disclosed
despite
the
patient
-
reluctance
.

however
,
this
argument
ignores
the
fact
that
terrorism
will
be
around
regardless
of
whether
nuclear
plants
are
built
or
not
.

therefore
we
can
see
those
students
are
only
encouraged
to
greater
explore
and
express
their
creativity
during
their
tertiary
years
of
studies
.

take
china
as
-
example
;
there
are
two
main
problems
in
hampering
the
development
of
innovation
.

according
to
rogers
(
2003
)
,
skunkwork
refers
to
a
small
group
of
highly
selected
people
designated
to
do
research
for
an
innovation
without
carry
out
tedious
organization
procedures
.

this
issue
particularly
affects
innovations
that
are
on
the
larger
scale
,
as
large
cost
will
be
incurred
in
the
construction
of
its
foundations
.

because
engineering
designs
are
always
related
to
real
problem
,
during
the
five
processes
,
the
obstacles
they
face
are
more
than
theories
and
calculations
on
paper
.

in
2000-2001
,
seniors
accounted
for
43
percent
of
total
health
care
spending
but
represented
only
12.5
percent
of
the
population
.

it
is
highly
notable
that
since
chenobyl
incident
there
is
no
more
any
accident
.

therefore
,
it
is
necessary
for
the
government
to
review
the
public
policies
for
the
elderly
.

after
the
accident
,
people
tried
to
figure
out
what
are
the
reasons
that
caused
the
malfunction
of
the
power
plant
.

it
is
because
rfid
is
able
to
efficiently
detect
terrorists
and
criminals
who
hide
drugs
in
their
bodies
,
all
objects
made
by
mental
,
all
explosive
devices
and
so
on
.

with
the
maturing
of
the
technologies
on
electric
motors
and
long-life
battery
,
multiple
types
of
electric
vehicle
could
have
been
created

how
to
ensure
that
there
will
be
enough
space
for
all
people
to
accommodate
in
a
condition
of
land
scarcity
,
especially
in
singapore
,
a
country
with
-
total
area
of
710.2
square
kilometres
.

a
higher
income
will
allow
the
younger
generation
to
support
themselves
better
and
therefore
provide
for
their
own
parents
,
allowing
the
government
to
spend
less
on
caring
for
the
old
.

however
,
the
engineer
who
had
created
the
rods
had
not
expected
the
chemical
structure
inside
the
rod
-
actually
increase
the
reactions
between
-
radiation
atoms
at
the
first
moment
when
being
put
into

this
is
because
they
will
miss
out
-
the
opportunities
to
access
to
the
large
database
of
information
,
goods
and
services
online
.

but
as
for
the
eco-car
,
the
resources
it
uses
may
not
be
readily
available
,
so
it
-
will
not
be
very
convenient
.

in
an
era
which
the
scale
of
our
industrial
system
is
growing
larger
and
larger
,
the
consumption
of
resource
becomes
an
incredible
burden
on

environment
and
people
start
to
suffer
the
aftermath
for
the
destruction

pollution
we
have
done
to

,
a
series
of

have
been
raised
.

moreover
,
it
is
more
economic
to
develop
msrs
.

therefore
,
with
the
cpf
scheme
created
by
the
government
it
has
successfully
created
a
financial
security
for
the
aged
and
they
would
not
need
to
search
for
employment
to
support
their
financial
needs
.

health
sector
would
be
one
of
the
areas
where
help
is
needed
for
the
aged
due
to
the
rising
medical
expenditure
,
thus
not
being
fair
to
burden
them
with
the
entire
cost
.

in
this
way
,
the
children
will
have
more
financial
allowance
to
take
care
of
the
parents
.

therefore
,
mostly
these
health
care
centres
are
located
to
the
places
where
a
high
proportion
of
older
people
are
staying
.

due
to
the
lack
in
fund
,
there
is
money
to
hire
research
engineering
,
research
equipment
and
materials
on
experiment
.

thus
,
-
individual
should
decide
what
is
best
for
him
.

however
,
the
use
of
rfid
in
tracking
people
has
brought
about
many
controversies
.

for
the
past
years
,
the
controversy
of
surveillance
technology
infringing
-
one
's
right
to
privacy
still
exists
and
will
continue
to
happen
.

the
government
could
offer
scholarships
or
offer
subsidize
school
fees
based
on
their
income
level
in
order
to
help
to
generate
more
higher
educated
people
so
that
the
effects
of
having
little
education
and
not
being
able
to
save
during
one
's
economically
active
years
could
be
minimized
.

older
people
tend
to
work
and
save
less
and
also
require
more
health
care
.

in
addition
,
encouraging
later
retirement
has
proved
to
ease
the
ageing
process
.

to
be
more
accurate
,
in
the
developing
countries
,
-
government
should
make
a
good
plan
to
build
irrigation
canal
and
bank
based
on
the
analysis
of
local
climate
and
geography
.

many
-
view
that
the
government
is
negating
the
older
generation
.

simply
by
scanning
at
the

the

of

``

experienced

fast
neutron
reactors
over
five
decades
and
in

''
.

it
was
found
out
that
the
research
team
did
n't
agree
with
the
public
view
and
claimed
that
it
was
-
individual-blame
perspective
.

therefore
,
it
is
vital
that
senior
citizens
have
a
healthy
lifestyle
and
to
be
active
in
the
workforce
in
order
for
one
to
be
in
good
health
and
-
ability
to
self-provide
.

in
my
home
country
,
i
feel
that
the
2
main
problems
that
affect
the
engineering
design
processes
for
innovation
hampered
are
the
lack
of
government
support
in
engineering
innovative
design
area
and
social
problem
.

and
there
are
still
a
lot
of
aspects
that
contribute
to
technology
as
well
.

however
,
once
the
basis
infrastructure
has
been
laid
down
,
nuclear
power
turns
in
to
a
readily
accessible
and
cheaply
recoverable
source
of
energy
(
european
physical
society

with
this
idea
of

,
i
would
build
a

of

test
on
the
effectiveness

there
should
be
sufficient
funds
set
aside
to
provide
updated
facilities
for
the
schools
-
as
well
as
to
maintain
the
quality
of
the
teaching
force
.

hence
,
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
restricted
.

the
government
has
to
concern
about
this
issue
,
so
the
further
impact
would
not
happen
in
the
future
.

yet
over
the
years
,
when
this
group
of
people
increases
,
especially
in
rather
high
rate
,
the
amount
needed
will
be
more
than
the
amount
-
put
aside
then
.

in
recent
decades
,
many
countries
have
invested
a
certain
amount
of
money
in
areas
such
as
science
and
technology
-
in
order
to
develop
new
products
such
as
an
intelligent
system
,
ishoe
and
big
button
tv
remote
controller
that
would
help
the
elderly
.

after
these
battles
and
wars
,
-
chinese
people
finally
stepped
in
to
a
new
era
,
a
peaceful
but
impoverished
era
.

there
are
policies
like
revising
the
retirement
age
from
65
to
67
in
-
united
states
(
u.s.
social
security
administration
,
1
april
2009
)
and
also
in
taiwan
from
60
to
65
.

(
banks

hanny
,
pachano
&
thompson
,

)
secondly
,
the
use
of
rfid
to
track
people
is
for
the
safety
of
workers
who
are
working
in
hazardous
working
conditions
.

by
making
use
of
genetic
testing
to
test
individual
's
genes
,
one
will
be
able
to
know
whether
he
or
she
will
develop
-
genetic
disease
or
carry
any
disease-causing
genes
.

but
now
,
scientists
have
developed
six
new
type
of
nuclear
reactor
called
nuclear
reactor
generation
iv
which
are
said
to
be
safer
than
previous
generations
.

before
the
release
of
-
refrigerator
into
the
large
potential
market
of
common
household
,
there
is
an
ideal
substitute
for
-
electric
refrigerator
-
gas
refrigerator
,
which
has
a
quieter
operation
and
longer
use
duration
(
cowan
,
cited
by
roger
,
2003
)
.

in
my
own
opinion
,
i
agree
with
the
latter
,
for
these
following
reasons
.

however
,
being
likely
to
face
discrimination
from
society
,
individuals
should
also
have
the
choice
to
conceal
the
information
from
others
.

on
the
other
hand
,
supporters
of
surveillance
technology
state
that
surveillance
technology
plays
an
important
role
in
crime
detection
and
prevention
thus
maintaining
the
country
's
security
and
prevent
terrorist
attacks
.

if
-
elderly
do
not
have
enough
savings
to
support
,
they
may
depend
financially
on
the
government
or
their
children
.

the
british
government
was
-
very
worried
about
this
condition
.

as
stated
from
the
source
,
``
eldershield
is
an
affordable
severe
disability
insurance
scheme
which
provides
basic
financial
protection
to
those
who
needs
long-term
care
,
especially
during
old
age
.
''

for
example
,
in
april
30
2009
-
when
lipoxen
(
pharmaceutical
companies
)
announced
-
positive
preclinical
results
for
the
delivery
of
an
enhanced
influenza
vaccine
,
adding
that
the
technology
should
also
work
against
the
new
swine
flu
strain
,
lipoxen
's
share
price
when
up
from
£6.62
(
$
10.11
)
to
£21.75
(
$
33.23
)
(
brady
huggett
,
2009
)
.

in
order
to
solve
this
problem
,
the
government
have
implemented
certain
policies
to
aids
the
aged
,
some
of
the
policies
are
the
introduction
of
the
central
provident
funds
,
tax
reliefs
and
the
public
housing
scheme
.

in
such
-
situation
,
time
is
of
essence
.

generally
,
the
engineering
design
process
consists
mainly
of
the
five
procedures
mentioned
by
khandani
(
2005
)
which
includes
defining
the
problem
,
gathering
the
relevant
information
,
think
of
solutions
to
the
problem
,
analyze
and
select
one
solution
,
and
test
it
out
by
implementing
it
.

in
fact
,
several
countries
have
already
implemented
means
testing
systems
that
reflects
the
above
idea
.

the
key
difference
in
these
two
products
is
the
support
they
received
during
the
creation
process
.

on
top
of
this
,
the
education
system
in
singapore
does
not
emphasise
on
creativity
.

the
public
spending
is
,
thus
needed
to
rectify
the
perception
shaped
by
the
children
,
or
else
the
problem
will
remain
unsolved
.

in
conclusion
,
the
creation
of
electric
generated
vehicle
can
reduce
air
pollution
problem
that
is
becoming
more
and
more
serious
nowadays
.

longer
life
expectancy
and
-
continuous
falling
population
have
caused
the
aging
population
in
singapore
to
increase
.

as
a
consequence
,
the
hot
exhaust
gas
leaked
through
the
joint
and
burned
everything
up
.

money
is
spent
to
adopt
the
change
to
meet
the
current
technology
.

at
the
same
time
,
volunteers
can
play
a
part
in
helping
to
treat
as
listeners
.

the
approaches
that
countries
usually
adopt
to
solve
the
aging
issue
include
the
prolonging
of
working
lives
of
the
elderly
and
the
provision
of
an
array
of
welfare
pension
schemes
for
them
.

thus
,
it
not
only
eliminates
danger
for
those
elderly
people
,
but
also
reduces
the
worrying
time
and
effort
for
their
families
.

studies
have
shown
that
the
vhtr
is
able
to
produce
up
to
600mwt
which
is
about
27
times
larger
compared
to
msr
with
22mwt
.

in
addition
,
vhtr
would
be
able
to
function
without
the
need
of
reprocessing
plutonium
waste
.

take
for
example
the
housing
in
singapore
,
which
comprises
mainly
of
housing
development
board
[
hdb
]
flats
.

however
-
since
the
benefits
reaped
from
surveillance
technology
overpowers
the
inconvenience
it
results
in
,
surveillance
technology
should
indeed
be
used
to
track
people
.

since
the
prime
minister
had
already
envisaged
a
need
to
create
a
better
living
environment
for
singaporeans
,
so
why
not
we
lessen
the
spending
on
the
aged
and
invest
it
on
realising
this
wonderful
concept
?

in
the
past
,
it
is
used
to
track
equipments
and
data
and
this
does
not
create
much
controversy
in
the
issue
of
privacy
.

the
elderly
in
singapore
are
dependent
on
government
subsidies
in
various
areas
due
to
high
cost
of
-
living
in
present
society
.

this
is
due
to
its
ability
of
operating
at
higher
pressure
and
temperature
(
at
550
degree
celsius
)
with
a
single
phase
operation
,
unlike
the
current
lwrs
that
need
recirculation
of
heat
and
components
like
jet
pumps
and
steam
generators
.

by
living
a
healthier
life
,
the
elderly
people
can
live
their
days
more
normally
and
hence
-
help
them
to
ease
the
aging
process
.

therefore
,
it
is
not
true
to
say
that
the
working
adults
bear
a
heavier
burden
from
supporting
their
parents
when
government
incentives
are
provided
.

an
article
on
hotel
new
world
collapse
,
tan
(
1999
)
claimed
that
investigations
showed
the
collapse
was
due
to
under
design
made
by
the
engineers
,
shoddy
workmanship
and
cost
cutting
made
by
the
contractors
(
tan
,
1999
)
.

on
the
other
hand
,
senior
activity
centres
are
also
developed
in
housing
estate
to
encourage
-
elderly
-
remain
integrated
in
society
.

lastly
,
filial
obligation
is
also
one
of
the
methods
to
decrease
the
negative
impact
of
fast-aging
population
.

while
the
idea
of
improving
education
to
ease
the
aging
problem
in
the
future
is
workable
,
there
may
still
be
a
problem
of
individuals
who
will
not
be
able
to
follow
this
plan
.

however
,
these
aesthetic
procedures
are
costly
and
usually
not
subsidised
by
the
government
.

as
the
living
conditions
improve
and
technology
advances
,
people
are
able
to
lead
a
healthier
lifestyle
and
live
longer
as
compared
to
the
past
.

the
difference
between
a
serendipitous
discovery
and
a
researched
technology
are
the
-
resources
invested
in
the
development
,
and
how
the
technology
is
gauged
to
be
a
success
.

another
impact
is
the
sustainability
of
families
,
because
there
is
far
less
children
supporting
far
more
elderly
.

we
measure
performance
by
what
is
the
output
that
the
system
can
produce
and
the
amount
of
power
it
can
generate
.

however
,
since
to
ensure
safety
is
the
primary
goal
of
msr
,
it
has
good
safety
factors
.

the
element
sodium
has
a
low
boiling
point
of
1156
kelvins
,
compared
to
lead
's
higher
2023
kelvins
,
which
is
dangerous
-
it
becomes
overheated
and
starts
to
boils
(
hejzlar
,
2009
)
.

in
addition
to
their
past
contributions
,
the
aged
are
likely
to
be
able
to
continue
contributing
to
the
society
,
by
-
simply
passing
on
their
wealth
of
experience
or
adding
diversity
and
vibrancy
to
a
nation
.

on
the
other
hand
,
for
those
having
disease
like
alzheimer
's
disease
,
surveillance
technology
facilitate
in
finding
them
out
if
they
get
lost
in
somewhere
else
.

according
to
wikipedia
,
statistic
shows
that
19.6
%
from
the
resident
non-students
aged
15
years
and
over
got
no
qualification
in
education
of
-
year
2000
.

they
argue
that
the
potential
threaten
of
rfid
is
substantial
since
it
contains
so
much
private
information
,
therefore
,
if
abusing
rfid
will
lead
to
a
serious
consequence
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
people
will
also
have
greater
disposable
income
,
to
be
self
reliance
,
in
order
to
support
their
aged
parents
.

besides
those
,
architectural
improvement
has
helped
aged
people
both
with
and
without
disability
to
be
able
to
travel
by
themselves
.

how
other
people
get
to
know
-
your
products
and
been
convinced
to
use
them
.

from
the
examples
i
have
given
,
we
can
say
that
there
are
so
many
areas
to
be
fixed
in
indonesia
's
economy
that
can
improve
the
situation
of
it
.

firstly
,
the
concept
of
vhtr
is
the
most
practical
among
the
6
reactor
concepts
.

for
example
in
afghanistan
,
according
to
statistics
,
the
unemployment
rate
is
estimated
to
be
as
high
as
40
%
in
2008
(
cia
,
2009
)
.

invention
and
development
of
radio
has
better
the
society
in
numerous
ways
.

one
such
product
in
the
current
market
which
is
-
safe
for
opening
cans
,
handy
,
environmentally
friendly
and
ergonomically
stable
is
the
one
touch
can
opener
.

labor
costs
include
the
labor
from
varies
department
in
the
nuclear
plant
.

(
nuclear
power
plants
,
2009
)
.the
proliferation
of
the
new
nuclear
technology
is
causing
considerable
controversy
and
concern
;
opponents
say
that
nuclear
reactor
may
be
-
serious
threat
to
the
world
populace
as
well
as
the
environment
.

further
medical
treatments
can
be
conducted
if
another
doctor
reads
the
reports
.

however
,
it
is
better
to
use
the
path
of
feed-forward
control
of
safety
that
is
to
do
a
correct
original
system
design
right
from
the
beginning
.

this
prediction
is
further
supported
by
a
survey
conducted
by
the
world
bank
,
which
claims
the
continuously
increasing
expected
lifespan
since
1960
.

also
with
this
job
they
are
financially
independent
.

encouraging
senior
citizens
to
work
will
helps
in
contributing
back
to
the
society
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
ensure
that
they
are
financially
independent
.

anyway
,
in
the
case
of
the
three
``
-less
''
-
homeless
,
childless
and
jobless
,
indeed
they
should
savour
the
benefit
from
the
eldercare
programme
by
the
government
.

chances
are
this
accident
may
not
happen
.

in
conclusion
,
i
feel
that
public
funding
should
be
limited
as
it
may
cause
the
elderly
to
be
over
reliant
on
it
and
the
money
should
be
used
elsewhere
in
areas
such
as
public
health
that
is
more
pressing
and
on
education
and
economic
growth
-
that
will
also
help
to
solve

aging
population

under
high
temperature
condition
,
so
this
kind
of
inert
gas
can
protect
the
system
during
the
refrigeration
processing
.

these
encouragements
always
make
a
patient
to
be
more
confident
and
brave
,
thus
increasing
their
chances
for
survival
in
some
cases
.

for
example
,
by
increasing
the
radiological
intensity
of
materials
,
it
is
hard
for
people
to
handle
it
without
severely
expose
to
radioactive
if
highly
specialized
shielding
equipment
is
not
used
.

this
made
up
of
30
%
of
the
resident
population
in
the
constitution
.

among
the
diverse
energy
source
,
solar
power
has
the
brightest
prospect
for
its
non-pollution
,
safety
and
infinitude
.

critics
of
this
position
often
point
out
that
there
are
already
established
health
care
system
and
policies
in
place
to
subsidise
the
cost
of
health
care
and
that
changes
are
frequently
introduced
to
improve
them
.

people
will
-
definitely
not
give
up
this
nuclear
power
as
it
has
a
lot
of
potential
as
an
energy
source
.

as
for
the
appearance
there
are
four
major
designs
:
straight
,
flip
,
slide
and
rotation
.

reviewing
the
history
,
the
chernobyl
and
-
three
mile
island
catastrophe
indeed
witnessed
the
enormous
harm
the
nuclear
reactor
could
cause
.

city-

,
which
is
connected
to
city
hall
station
,
is
an
underground
network
of
shops
that
link
itself
to
other
larger
shopping
facilities
.

under
this
financial
plan
,
they
will
benefit
from
the
country
's
welfare
and
at
the
same
time
,
able
to
satisfy
their
basic
needs
.

according
to
prof
mirko
ascic
's
scientific
journal
(
ascic
,
2005
)
,
the
energy
of
neutrons
in
the
reactor
is
the
dominant
factor
that
affects
the
process
of
converting
heat
to
electricity
.

in
both
example
,
regardless
of
its
method
of
discoveries
,
both
are
beneficial
to
mankind
and
help
to
improve
the
quality
of
life
.

unlike
to
a
sound-powered
telephone
,
extra
functions
are
included
in
a
mobile
phone
,
providing
games
,
music
and
-
camera
for
use
.

with
strong
support
on
research
,
new
breakthrough
can
be
discovered
to
cure
chronic
illness
or
age
related
diseases
.

public
spending
on
the
elderly
should
therefore
be
limited
to
those
with
chronic
conditions
or
need
immediate
attention
who
can
not
afford
the
cost
of
healthcare
to
avoid
abuse
and
increase
of
taxpayers
'
money
.

the
reason
behind
this
is
that
serendipitous
discoveries
cater
to
solve
the
problems
in
more
ingenious
ways
,
as
they
may
be
the
results
of
some
unknown
happenings
,
and
they
are
produced
by
following
some
rules
of
the
nature
we
have
yet
to
gain
an
understanding
of
,
which
are
mysterious
but
also
powerful
.

``
[

]
suffice
to
say
,
limiting
public
spending
on
the
elderly
must
be
considered
in
order
to
maintain
a
sustainable
economy
.

if
doctors
use
organs
which
are
obtained
by
stem
cells
,
many
technical
problems
can
be
solved
,
like
rejection
reaction
and
the
shortage
problem
.

to
conclude
,
it
would
be
very
wise
of
the
government
to
limit
its
spending
on
the
aging
,
and
to
divert
the
money
to
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

for
example
,
japan
's
phone
companies
have
actually
offer
phone
models
which
have
bigger
screens
and
larger
font
sizes
,
enhanced
audibility
and
easier-
to-operate
keys
to
attract
the
elderly
.

if
we
look
a
little
deeper
into
the
causes
that
lead
to
the
opposite
solution
,
we
will
find
that
the
focus
that
specific
group
of
people
pays
attention
to
is
,
obviously
,
quite
different
from
each
other
.

some
criticize
ferociously
that
such
mass
surveillance
is
the
step
towards
the
totalitarian
world
described
in
jorge
orwell
's
1984.they
fear
the
fictional
orwellian
may
even
become
true
,
which
will
be
a
disaster
for
human
beings
.

secondly
,
the
controllability
of
the
both
of
short
term
and
long
-
effects
of
lsd
and
risperidone
varies
greatly
.

besides
,
people
who
usually
do
gymnastic
will
live
longer
and
healthier
than
those
do
not
.

as
torgny
and
wilcke
states
,
information
can
allow
a
relative
who
has
considerably
increased
risk
of
a
disease
from
smoking
to
make
her
own
decisions
about
smoking
and
take
precautions
when
deciding
on
a
career
which
are
needful
to
have
a
positive
impact
on
her
future
.

operating
at
lower
pressures
reduces
accident
risk
unlike
with
the
current
lwr
and
fission
products
have
better
retention
in
the
event
of
an
accident
.

despite
challenges
within
steps
of
the
nuclear
fuel
cycle
that
do
exist
,
it
can
be
solved
with
improvements
in
technology
and
with
global
cooperation
.

in
order
to
benefit
whose
who
needs
help
more
,
subsidy
for
hospitalization
in
public
hospital
has
been
adjusted
so
that
60
percent
of
workers
are
able
to
enjoy
full
subsidy
for
type
c
and
b2
wards
whereas
those
have
higher
earning
power
will
receive
substantial
subsidies
for
both
c
and
b2
class
wards
(
khalik
,
2008
)
.

therefore
the
implementation
of
the
vhtr
can
offer
a
wide
range
of
solution
to
the
fuel
crisis
that
is
currently
troubling
the
public
.

an
elder
is
a
valuable
asset
if
we
know
how
to
make
use
of
their
strengths
and
not
focus
on
their
weakness
.

in
singapore
,
hospital
bed
shortages
have
been
a
perennial
problem
for
the
government
.

r
,
n.d
)
.

vast
amount
of
resources
,
manpower
and
time
have
been
invested
in
researches
involving
it
.

government
policies
and
the
restructuring
of
the
healthcare
system
have
helped
the
aged
cope
better
with
life
.

therefore
,
firstly
,
money
should
be
diverted
into
the
economic
sector
,
namely
stimulation
of
the
domestic
economy
.

in
the
end
,
the
locals
will
still
suffer
from
poverty
and
remain
unemployed
while
foreign
talent
will
have
numerous
jobs
to
choose
from
.

unlike
china
who
has
abundance
in
labour
,
singapore
on
the
other
hand
has
little
natural
resources
and
is
unable
to
compete
with
china
on
a
large
scale
.

thus
it
translates
to
higher
electrical
production
efficiency
meaning
that
it
can
produce
more
electrical
energy
.

this
substantially
supports
that
with
surveillance
technology
,
it
does
not
reduce
the
crime
rate
and
enhances
public
security
.

healthy
body
is
important
because
when
the
eldery
is
healthy
,
they
will
not
feel
useless
or
abandoned
.

under
this
act
,
the
minimum
retirement
age
in
singapore
is
62
years
-
,
-
thus
allowing
them
to
stay
longer
in
the
workforce
.

to
sum
up
,
even
though
the
aging
issue
is
quite
difficult
to
handle
,
but
still
,
public
spending
for
the
elderly
should
have
a
certain
limitation
.

however
,
the
use
of
-
opened
loop
fuel
system
in
swcr
can
prevent
the
proliferation
of
nuclear
arms
.

when
andrew
murray
knocked
the
ball
out
of
the
bound
,
-
hawk-eye
did
not
recognize
it
and
finally
murray
beat
ivan
ljubicic
and
got
in
the
semifinal
.

burj
al-arab

,
the
most

luxury
hotel
worldwide
once
accomplished
in
dec
1999
,
was
certainly
becoming
one
of
the
most
dazzling
architecture
at
that
time
.

moreover
,
the
mental
preparedness
of
the
patient
is
most
likely
moulded
on
the
pre-test
counselling
before
genetics
testing
is
carry
out
.

intrusion
of
privacy
and
upsetting
-
the
various
balances
in
society
are
concerns
people
are
increasingly
worried
about
.

(
lee
and
tan
,
2007
)
-
however
,
individual
should
also
have
their
right
to
security
,
which
in
turn
allows
the
intervention
of
government
.

to
accommodate
to
this
current
changing
age
structure
,
on-going
development
of
government
policies
,
covering
areas
like
economics
,
social
and
architecture
,
have
been
carried
out
aggressively
through
these
years
.

only
a
small
group
of
the
aging
population
faces
the
limitations
and
the
government
can
also
come
out
with
other
policies
to
solve
the
problems
so
that
the
approach
implemented
can
-
workable
without
any
flaws
and
limitation
.

last
but
not
the
least
;
engineers
are
trying
hard
to
put
their
dream
in
to
reality
.

aging
process
is
a
time
induced
process
that
causes
changes
on
physical
,
psychological
and
social
.

now
,
nuclear
weapons
,
from
what
we
know
,
can
be
flown
to
a
faraway
place
to
cause
massive
destruction
.

with
more
research
and
investments
in
the
nuclear
technology
,
the
sfr
can
become
a
viable
energy
source
in
the
future
.

proliferation
of
surveillance
devices
threatens
privacy
.

considering
the
nuclear
technology
,
what
method
we
use
to
control
the
reaction
has
been
improved
a
lot
.

technology
is
a
material
object
which
is
used
to
increase
the
ability
to
adapt
to
one
's
environment
(
``
technology
,
''
2009
)
.

as
people
aged
,
their
health
condition
will
not
be
as
healthy
as
before
.

if
the
genetic
testing
is
revealed
to
the
relatives
and
they
end
up
having
the
same
disease
,
they
could
be
saved
by
preventing
the
disease
to
develop
further
more
.

for
the
financially
strapped
elderly
,
they
will
receive
the
necessary
subsidies
for
medical
cost
,
-
transportation
cost
from
the
government
.

safety
of
bystanders
is
also
considered
where
design
safety
is
concerned
.

highly
radioactive
spent
fuel
requires
constant
cooling
.

to
deal
with
such
challenges
,
governments
have
only
two
options
,
one
of
which
is
to
reduce
the
future
old-age
dependency
-
burden
by
increasing
available
resources
.

it
allows
the
immigration
officers
to
have
an
idea
of
the
background
of
the
tourist
or
citizen
that
is
entering
the
country
.

the
rapid
application
for
patents
causes
large
numbers
of
patent
infringement
cases
.

with
this
subsidy
,
the
more
elderly
will
be
able
to
afford
the
medical
care
as
compared
to
before
.

the
radiation
coming
from
these
nuclear
wastes
will
not
only
produce
an
instant
harm
,
but
also
a
long-term
effect
on
residents
in
affected
areas
,
spreading
across
generations
.

with
the
advent
of
modern
technology
and
sciences
,
living
to
a
ripe
old
age
was
nothing
too
spectacular
.

in
conclusion
,
rfid
is
useful
to
track
children
-
activities
and
seniors
'
daily
routine
to
prevent
kidnapping
and
improve
health
care
respectively
.

and
with
sufficient
economic
development
,
there
will
be
more
choices
for
governments
to
care
for
the
old
.

as
we
can
see
,
the
using
of
wheelchairs
,
audiphones
,
glasses
...
has
contributed
a
lot
in
facilitating
the
old
people
in
their
life
.

according
to
rogers
(
2003
)
,
six
main
stages
are
involved
in
the
way
to
come
out
the
technology
,
they
are
recognizing
a
problem
,
research
,
development
,
commercialization
,
diffusion
and
adoption
and
consequences
.

hence
,
for
-
small
country
such
as
singapore
-
which
human
resources
is
the
key
factor
for
the
success
,
it
is
important
that
the
citizen
constantly
upgrade
themselves
with
the
latest
knowledge
.

older
workers
can
be
absorbed
with
the
establishment
of
light
industries
and
machine-based
industries
.

all
these
obstacles
show
that
raising
-
retirement
age
does
not
address
well
to
the
concerns
of
an
elderly
-
.

therefore
government
step
in
to
ensure
that
for
the
total
sales
of
automobile
10
percent
must
be
nonpolluting
,
which
meant
that
it
has
to
be
electric
car
or
electric/gasoline
cars
.

living
in
poverty
,
the
younger
generations
-
grow
up
with
poor
opportunities
to
accumulate
wealth
to
support
themselves
,
let
alone
supporting
their
next
generations
when
they
become
old
.

good
health
is
still
the
most
crucial
area
where
everyone
would
wish
to
achieve
after
all
.

some
of
-
elderly
are
also
wheel
chair
bounded
which
adds
on
to
the
diffculty
to
travel
.

with
medical
technology
advances
today
,
genetic
testing
have
been
commonly
used
to
detect
any
disorders
or
diseases
that
is
present
in
our
genes
.

references
:

this
is
to
ensure
that
the
workforce
will
remain
sufficient
and
efficient
,
as
a
shrinking
society
will
only
face
the
threats
of
declining
economic
vitality
.

with
the
advancement
in
science
and
technology
nowadays
,
the
level
of
danger
of
the
nuclear
reactors
would
be
minimised
to
the
lowest
degree
.

this
projected
a
significant
growth
in
the
aging
population
through
these
years
.

nuclear
-
is
definitely
a
viable
option
that
can
meet
this
demand
.

besides
,
the
external
cost
-
including
the
pollution
to
-
environment
-
of
nuclear
energy
was
0.4eruo
cents/kwh
while
for
coal
energy
-
it
was
4.0

cents
.

after
all
,
user
's
financial
problem
in
economic

demand
for

contributed
to
the

through
several
years
.

funding
and
materials
are
crucial
during
an
engineering
design
process
as
trials
and
equipment
are
require
to
gauge
and
judge
the
progress
and
the
progress
and
outcome
of
a
development
.

however
,
when
a
person
is
confirmed
with
certain
genetic
risk
,
a
question
arises
is
it
an
obligation
for
the
person
to
tell
his
or
her
relatives
about
the
risk
?

in
conclusion
,
the
two
examples
we
mentioned
have
shown
that
engineering
processes
can
play
a
big
part
in
the
designing
phrase
of
a
product
,
like
how
they
make
the
thermometers
safer
and
the
wheelchair
better
for
us
.

as
one
ages
,
our
body
tends
to
be
more
vulnerable
to
healthcare
problems
,
this
will
add
on
to
the
medical
cost
which
requires
funding
from
the
government
,
thus
putting
greater
stress
on
the
younger
generation
with
increasing
taxes
.

this
is
made
possible
only
with
the
advancement
of
technology
as
compared
to
the
past
.

in
this
case
,
they
may
not
have
the
financial
ability
to
take
care
of
themselves
without
the
help
from
the
government
.

therefore
,
scientists
,
businessmen
and
governments
must
work
together
to
find
a
feasible
solution
in
balancing
economic
growth
with
sustainability
.

secondly
,
the
behaviors
of
the
users
also
cause
many
problems
when
providing
the
products
to
the
market
.

thus
,
although
-
initially
the
construction
expense
is
high
,
later
more
profit
can
be
achieved
.

singapore
can
tap
on
the
aging
population
to
assist
in
the
growth
of
the
country
:

as

is
concerned

therefore
,
in

parts

are
coming
up
with
policies
and
sponsoring
researches

they
found
that
,
when
they
used
a
neutron
to
collide
with
another
heavy
nuclear
,
the
nuclear
broke
into
two
parts
and
there
was
some
mass
lost
.

it
is
about
whether
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
so
that
money
can
be
diverted
to
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

if
these
factors
are
not
fulfilled
,
electric
cars
would
still
probably
ends
up
as
a
failed
dream
.

it
's
inevitable
there
is
still
a
group
of
aged
people
who
could
n't
take
care
of
their
own
welfare
,
it
's
the
responsibility
of
a
caring
government
to
take
care
of
their
needs
.

many
genetic
disorders
such
as
cancers
will
lead
to
serious
consequences
if
the
carrier
does
not
have
a
healthy
lifestyle
to
protect
himself
.

with
this
scheme
,
-
elderly
are
able
to
afford
the
services
which
are
specially
created
for
them
.

thus
,
site
separation
is
an
important
step
for
recycling
of
construction
waste
.

overcoming
a
problem
requires
time
and
repeating
trial
to
make
sure
that
the
product
is
safe
to
use
and
works
efficiently
.

smallpox
vaccine
is
the
first
vaccine
that
people
used
to
improve
immunity
to
a
certain
disease
.

with
the
efforts
of
countless
scientists
and
engineers
,
these
challenges
are
expected
to
be
solved
in
a
few
years
.

such
demographic
changes
might
bring
about
severe
consequences
,
most
importantly
national
budgets
might
be
under
pressure
as
-
growing
number
of
elderly
persons
are
supported
-
fewer
younger
persons
.

secondly
,
the
attempt
to
raise
the
fertility
rates
could
also
be
one
the
possible
solutions
.

hence
,
the
first
stage
of
the
engineering
design
process
has
to
be
thought
out
carefully
.

this
might
lead
to
foreign
corporations
being
discouraged
to
invest
in
singapore
as
singapore
might
be
perceived
as
not
having
an
effective
system
-
therefore
it
can
be
concluded
that
the
aged
should
have
a
bigger
portion
of
the
pie
that
is
the
public
spending
-
while
the
other
areas
will
still
be
having
their
share
too
to
maintain
their
standards
in
developed
countries
.

it
can
be
insufficient
knowledge
of
operators
,
inadequate
training
of
operators
,
poor
design
and
poor
communication
among
team
members
.

this
will
enhance
the
self
esteem
of
them
-
thus
they
will
be
able
to
participate
more
actively
in
social
activities
and
they
will
not
feel
left
out
.

the
new
comprehensive
education
system
should
include
firm
beliefs
that
one
should
take
care
of
their
parents
when
they
're
old
,
instilling
a
filial
piety
mind-set
.

to
civilians
,
they
regard
suffering
people
who
live
in
starve
and
thirst
,
or
the
traffic
system
that
influence
people
's
daily
life
.

this
can
be
done
by
improving
on
the
economic
issue
of
their
country
,
educating
the
-
importance
of
taking
care
of
the
elderly
and
implementing
laws
on
negligence
issue
of
elderly
.

for
instance
,
if
an
old
man
,
physically
fit
,
is
given
monetary
assistance
beyond
the
minimum
necessities
,
he
will
be
compelled
not
to
work
even
so
if
the
benefit
greatly
make
up
a
large
part
of
his
salary
.

however
,
to
some
people
,
especially
the
younger
minds
,
they
disagree
with
such
-
scheme
.

many
argue
that
limiting
public
spending
on
the
elderly
would
only
leave
individuals
and
their
families
to
face
-
issues
pertaining
to
education
,
housing
,
social
services
and
transportation
.

however
,
not
only
facilities
but
also
the
treatments
of
patients
should
also
be
improved
.

in
recent
years
,
scientists
have
developed
a
new
concept
of
nuclear
energygeneration
iv
reactors
.

with
this
nuclear
material
,
terrorist
can
create
what
are
known
as
``

,
and
make
threats
to
the
public
.

therefore
,
the
cost
is
not
a
problem
for

has
done
much
to

measures
in

high

(

.

however
,
due
to
the
improper
exploit
of
it
,
surveillance
technology
has
become
more
of
detrimental
than
beneficial
.

but
the
truth
is
nuclear
power
can
do
more
than
that
have
been
mentioned
.

the
use
of
-
multi-pass
flows
system
in
the
scwr
allows
the
production
of
process
heat
on
demand
and
improves
the
thermal
efficiency
.

one
of
the
reasons
for
development
in
generation
4
nuclear
reactor
plants
is
due
to
security
reason
.

for
instance
,
north
korea
performed
their
missile
test
-
few
months
ago
to
threat
south
korea
and
other
countries
.

it
can
not
be
denied
-
the
cost
of
nuclear
reactor
-
is
very
high
,
but
according
to
the
economics
of
nuclear
power
(
2008
)
,
in
2008
in
america
,
the
electricity
cost
for
nuclear
energy
per
kwh
was
8.34
cents
while
the
cost
of
coal
energy
was
8.51cents
.

besides
,
the
thick
fog
formed
worsened
the
situation
.

since
-
large
amount
of
money
is
needed
to
support
an
ageing
population
,
governments
have
to
increase
their
own
existing
pool
of
resources
to
order
to
generate
such
amount
of
capital
.

then
,
people
can
get
their

;
have
a
stable
income
for
living
.

-
i
believe
that
the
benefits
of
rfid
used
in
tracking
people
far
outweigh
the
'uncertain
'
disadvantages
and
thus
it
should
not
be
banned
.

in
addition
,
the
people
who
belong
to
the
working
class
are
not
the
ones
who
are
most
vulnerable
to
-
the
economic
crisis
.

even
in
today
when
the
technology
is
so
advanced
,
the
price
is
still
quite
high
.

at
the
same
times
,
there
are
many
evidences
show
that
nuclear
power
could
be
considered
as
the
best
suggestion
to
mitigate
global
warming
.

one
should
also
identify
the
fact
that
singapore
is
not
a
welfare
state
in
the
first
place
,
and
the
policies
were
shaped
more
to
self
reliance
than
relying
on
government
to
take
care
of
them
when
they
are
older
,
thus
in
this
context
,
it
is
possible
to
justify
the
point
that
public
spending
should
not
be
limited
-
so
that
money
can
be
diverted
to
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

this
new
reactors
operating
at
high
temperatures
will
do
improve
the
efficiency
and
safety
.

in
addition
,
the
global
warming
effects
may
result
in
droughts
which
will
reduce
crop
production
and
air
pollution
can
result
in
acid
rain
which
can
corrode
many
properties
.

overlook
in
one
area
can
lead
to
serious
consequences
.

falls
are
one
of
the
biggest
issues
caused
by
lowered
mobility
in
the
aged
.

by
providing
the
aged
with
health
services
and
benefits
and
inviting
immigrants
can
only
ease
the
aging
process
temporarily
.

however
,
this
instead
posed
a
challenge
to
psychology
to
help
modify
the
plant
design
by
the
method
of
feed-forward
safety
controls
which
could
be
applied
in
the
identification
for
safer
designs
phase
(
wilpert
,
2007
)
.

in
my
point
of
view
,
people
should
support
the
farther
research
on
msr
technology
to
fulfill
human
's
energy
consumption
in
the
future
.

after
knowing
of
-
possible
genetic
condition
,
one
may
think
twice
before
deciding
to
conceive
a
child
.

thus
,
the
huge
amount
of
funds
pumped
into
research
and
development
on
nuclear
power
,
which
will
not
support
us
for
a
long-run
,
is
not
cost-effective
.

furthermore
,
with
the
forth
coming

.

ageing
population
is
currently
a
global
phenomenon
that
occurs
in
many
parts
of
the
world
.

the
other
common
aspect
that
may
have
some
influence
in
the
safety
area
is
the
reaction
between
coolant
and
the
crust
of
the
reactor
which
may
directly
results
in
radioactivity
leaking
and
even
explosion
.

technology
created
via
research
has
significant
difference
in
comparison
with
-
technology
resulted
from
serendipitous
discovery
in
several
aspects
.

some
solutions
as
examples
would
be
to
design
plants/fertilizers
that
give
higher
yield
or
working
with
health
experts
introducing
new
ways
to
control
population
growth
.

gunpowder
did
n't
have
a
chance
to
step
onto
the
stage
of
the
history
until
the
famous
adventurer
and
merchant
marco
polo
introduce
it
to
europe
from
china
.

when
nokia
upgraded
its
n
series
hand
phone
annually
,
iphone
of
the
apple
company
surprise
the
world
,
because
it
give
a
different
definition
of
touching
the
phone
.

under
this
mode
of
education
for
-
long
time
,
people
's
thinking
is
limited
and
rigid
.

it
is
often
argued
that
the
implantation
of
rfid
is
a
violation
of
privacy
.

without
a
limitation
based
on
the
results
of
means
testing
,
it
would
lead
to
a
large
number
of
people
applying
for
grants
even
when
they
are
not
in
dire
need
for
such
concessions
.

for
example
,
the
improvement
of
the
reverse-osmosis
process
that
creates
newater
and
the
development
of
the
'eco-friendly
'
vehicles
.

therefore
-
to
make
the
aged
more
employable
,
there
is
a
need
to
move
away
from
-
seniority-wage
system
and
reduce
the
cpf
rates
.

in
addition
,
the
governement
has
also
increased
its
subsidies
for
day
care
,
nursing
home
-
,
and
hospital
to
give
the
elderly
a
better
quality
of
servies
.

on
top
of
its
technological
readiness
,
the
sfr
is
designed
for
high
efficiency
as
well
.

despite
the
fact
that
the
approaches
they
take
are
obviously
different
,
they
share
the
same
goal
,
which
is
to
innovate
the
future
products
.

third
,
it
is
the
bike
bug
level
of
acceptance
to
consumers
.

this
policy
will
give
the
older
people
a
chance
to
work
longer
and
contribute
to
the
society
.

current
nuclear
plants
(
known
as
generation
iii
)
and
also
future
ones
emit
only
hot
steam
while
other
electricity
producers
like
coal
plants
pollute
the
environment
with
co2
and
so2
.

moreover
,
the
rate
of
birth
-
kept
falling
down
and
-
family
will
have
less
adult
children
than
they
had
in
the
past
,
which
puts
more
burdens
together
with
aging
population
to
the
government
to
deal
with
.

as
wilpert
(
2007
)
states
,
safety
of
engineering
design
depends
on
three
things
,
namely
,
effective
process
,
production
control
and
failure
avoidance
.

radioactive
emission
can
be
from
nuclear
explosion
or
nuclear
waste
.

moreover
,
this
service
system
allows
patients
to
get
consultation
from
doctor
using
the
device
whenever
they
fell
unwell
.

money
should
be
spent
on
education
,
research
and
growing
the
country
's
economy
so
that
people
can
have
larger
income
to
tap
upon
.

the
penicillium
notanum
can
prevent
the
growth
of
bacteria
.

most
of
the
elderly
do
not
have
proper
education
that
is
needed
in
today
's
society
in
order
to
meet
ends
needs
.

from
the
above
examples
in
different
continents
,
it
is
inevitable
to
conclude
that
elderly
employment
is
one
of
the
policies
that
have
been
well
adopted
by
various
governments
.

finally
3m
achieved
a
huge
success
as
its
products
were
world-famous
through
-
fortune
500
company
.

since
genetic
testing
is
beneficial
,
some
governments
have
come
up
with
legal
procedures
that
would
protect
suffers
from
genetic
discrimination
.

maybe
it
was
just
because
that
fleming
discovered
the
penicillin
by
chance
,
he
did
not
experience
any
failure
during
the
discovering
process
,
while
the
discovery
of
the
dna
's
structure
did
not
seem
to
be
that
easy
and
the
process
did
not
seem
to
be
smooth
,
either
.

apparently
,
the
cost
-
of
vhtr
is
really
high
.

in
sum
,
``
-
skunk
works
''
environment
is
much
tougher
than
conventional
environment
,
and
``
skunk
works
''
is
more
like
a
gamble
for
a
company
for
it
may
either
be
a
big
success
or
be
an
absolute
failure
.

the
old
aged
can
live
a
comfortable
life
without
worrying
or
without
seeking
for
financial
aid
around
.

due
to
that
,
singapore
is
facing
a
serious
declining
fertility
rate
that
resulted
in
huge
difference
between
the
aged
and
the
young
.

it
is
more
important
to
pay
attention
to
other
trends
and
characteristics
of
aging
population
in
order
to
solve
this
problem
it
in
some
other
ways
.

it
is
still
part
of
the
country
's
social
responsibility
to
take
care
of
the
aged
population
.

generating
new
concepts
do
not
just
require
a
single
day
of
effort
,
as
what
people
believe
,
but
instead
require
a
longer
thought
process
which
may
take
days
or
even
months
.

opposition
argues
that
with
cctv
cameras
,
criminals
will
be
aware
that
they
are
being
watched
and
so
it
reduces
the
crime
rate
.

though
decades
of
self-reliance
had
taught
singaporeans
to
stand
firm
and
learnt
-
to
support
themselves
and
their
family
solely
,
now
they
can
no
longer
do
so
.

the
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
(
udhr
)
has
clearly
stated
out
that
all
human
beings
are
born
free
and
-
equal
in
dignity
and
rights
.

in
fact
,
the
idea
of
travelling
by
light
is
close
to
the
imagination
of
transporting
in
time
which
most
scientists
are
doing
research
on
now
.

to
address
the
safety
concerns
of
the
public
,
this
design
envisioned

safeguard
systems

tracking
of

make
possible
when
it
is
used
in
a

with

disapproval
of
ideas
due
to
fiscal
reasons
is
one
of
the
problems
.

some
companies
have
implanted
rfid
microchips
in
their
staffs
to
track
their
locations
and
information
.

hence
,
if
the
government
does
not
limit
the
spending
on
the
aged
,
smaller
budget
will
be
left
for
developing
education
.

according
to
park
officials
of
balboa
park
in
san
diego
,
california
,
nine
months
after
the
installation
of
-
surveillance
system
,
the
crime
rates
has
been
reduced
in
all
aspects
and
more
people
visits
the
park
as
they
feel
more
secured
(
nieto
1997
)
.

also
,
the
education
system
in
well
developed
cities
such
as
beijing
and
shanghai
is
under
restructure
to
better
prepare
the
younger
generation
to
compete
in
the
globalized
world
.

thus
,
the
offspring
will
not
have
the
defective
genes
-
hence
lowering
its
possibility
to
develop
the
disease
.

opponents
of
using
nuclear
power
claim
that
it
has
negative
impact
on
the
environment
because
of
some
accidents
which
had
happened
before
.

other
than
-
political
factor
and
-
use
of
inappropriate
rod
materials
,
-
incompetence
of
-
operator
,
-
unwise
decision
making
during
-
test
plan
,
and
-
deliberate
violation
against
-
procedure
for
safe
operation
account
to
this
disaster
(
denton
,
1997
)
.

every
time
before
we
try
to
improve
,
we
should
first
find
out
what
has
gone
wrong
and
where
is
the
disfigurement
.

the
last
step
is
-
test
and
implements
the
solution
that
involves
testing
,
construction
and
manufacturing
of
the
solution
to
the
design
problem
.

as
a
result
,
the
country
is
able
to
maintain
their
economic
competitive
edge
,
as
well
as
-
create
more
jobs
for
the
people
and
enjoy
higher
standard
of
living
.

for
example
,
a
healthy
diet
with
enough
vitamins
,
minerals
and
other
necessary
nutrition
-
together
with
regular
exercise
and
a
healthy
lifestyle
will
help
human
live
longer
and
maintain
their
prime
of
youth
.

however
,
as
science
and
technology
evolves
,
they
had
also
brought
up
numerous
problems
.

the
services
include
upgrading
of
lifts
to
access
every
floor
,
installation
of
support
handbars
in
washroom
and
setting
up
-
senior
activity
centre
in
the
neighbourhood
.

moreover
,
the
polyclinics
provide
highly
subsidized
medical
care
which
benefited
the
elderly
greatly
.

finally
,
the
inventions
and
innovations
of
lightbulb
and
microwave
oven
are
really
great
creations
for
human
beings
.

therefore
,
terrorism
should
not
become
the
obstacle
of
the
development
of
nuclear
reactor
.

in
this
essay
,
i
will
discuss
about
these
obstacles
and
how
they
affect
the
design
process
.

adding
on
,
fighters
of
today
are
even
more
advanced
and
able
to
break
the
sound
barrier
.

therefore
,
the
lack
of
fund
will
result
in
the
inability
to
hire
professionals
to
accomplish
the
task
.

furthermore
,
women
of
older
generation
in
singapore
had
particularly
low
average
incomes
because
they
received
lesser
education
.

with
promises
of
lower
cost
,
lesser
waste
and
a
safer
alternative
,
it
may
seem
that
nuclear
power
with
-
introduction
of
generation
iv
reactors
such
as
the
super-critical-water-
cooled
reactors
is
the
next
generation
of
power
plants
.

one
of
-
most
essential
ones
is
the
high
cost
of
a
reactor
,
which
will
deeply
affect
the
development
of
the
whole
nuclear
industry
.

instead
,
it
is
used
to
destroy
human
and
bring
misery
to
certain
people
.

compare
with
the
past
,
now
a
days
,
everything
can
be
done
easily
with
the
aid
of
technology
.

if
the
wheel
did
not
crack
,
no
metal
will
be
embedded
into
the
train
and
the
derailment
of
the
train
would
not
happen
.

but
the
reliability
of
this
gadget
has
not
been
tested
;
there
is
no
assurance
that
with
the
installing
of
this
surveillance
technology
all
criminals
and
medical
patients
can
be
detected
easily
.

the
phones
which
people
nowadays
possess
also
differs
from
the
past
,
in
terms
of
functions
,
design
and
size
.

a
slight
deviation
of
a
few
hundred
dollars
for
each
individual
will
sum
up
to
a
huge
amount
for
the
entire
state
.

beside
-
cultural
aspect
,
this
gave
us
a
slide
indication
that
the
people
there
may
have
problem
handling
their
finance
.

in
2008
,
the
united
state
government
has
increased
their
budget
allocation
for
nuclear
energy
and
the
research
and
development
for
generation
iv
power
plants
to
twenty-five
billion
dollars
(
barnett
,
2008
)
.

researchers
are
mainly
focusing
on
healthcare
and
infrastructure
.

for
example
,
singapore
-
main
retirement
's
scheme
,
the
central
provident
fund
system
,
is
one
of
the
way
of
funded
retirement
saving
.

so
,
i
think
with
proper
planning
on
the
spending
by
the
government
,
we
should
be
able
to
meet
the
balance
between
public
spending
on
the
aged
and
other
essential
spending
.

to
ease
this
process
,
our
economy
should
consider
excluded
people
,
the
old
of
the
society
and
let
them
know
how
to
prepare
for
their
stable
and
comfortable
future
as
we
all
are
getting
older
even
now
.

investment
especially
in
enhancing
the
medical
research
will
make
everyone
better
off
and
also
indirectly
helps
the
elderly
in
a
way
.

(
s.
h.
lee
,
2009
)
.

another
effect
is
demotivation
of
young
engineers
from
designing
new
product
,
because
the
rewards
the
society
gives
them
is
not
equal
to
their
long
time
hardworking
.

more
attentions
should
be
given
to
this
group
of
elderly
as
they
have
no
one
to
turn
to
if
they
require
help
in
their
household
.

looking
back
at
the
evolution
of
communication
,
the
mobile
phone
is
one
that
was
shaped
by
social
factors
.

magnetic
monopoles
detected
in
a
real
magnet
for
the
first
time
.

with
the
help
of
engineers
,
he
finally
invented
the
laptop
that
we
-
use
every
day
now
,
and
undoubtedly
,
his
achievement
made
a
great
success
in
computer
marketing
.

subsequently
,
a
series
of
unbelievable
plan
have
emerged
.

in
singapore
,
the
creation
of
the
circle
line
that
would
be
fully
operated
by
2011
,
has
increased
the
accessibility
of
places
in
the
country
.

the
lack
of
resources
and
equipments
in
the
first
place
cost
china
a
few
decades
to
solve
it
;
then
the
whole
industry
went
on
well
for
several
years
as
many
aircrafts
were
produced
;
however
the
government
started
to
give
wrong
guidance
and
became
unstable
and
caused
a
huge
damage
to
the
industry
.

nuclear
technology
's
special
function
in
military
usage
makes
international
cooperation
in
this
technology
extremely
difficult
;
the
radioactive
character
of
this
technology
causes
a
lot
of
environmental
issues
and
its
cost
in
some
applications
is
still
high
.

nothing
beats
aging
with
a
healthy
body
and
mind
,
the
golden
years
should
be
spent
enjoyably
.

the
majority
of
the
population
is
still
the
young
who
are
now
sweating
and
toiling
for
the
country
-
just
like
what
the
aged
had
done
in
the
past
.

in
the
other
hand
,
peterson
(
2001
)
had
suggested
that
societies
in
weak
extended
family
,
high
elder
poverty
and
quick-rising
of
long
term
care
costs
should
learn
from
japan
where
most
elderly
people
still
living
with
their
adult
children
.

hence
,
many
researcher
have
to
'make
up
'
essays
on
their
own
sake
,
or
simply
plagiarize
other
's
works
.

in
order
to
find
a
way
out
,
dubai
has
made
a
crucial
decision
which
shifts
its
economic
center
from
oil
to
tourism
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
scientists
keep
giving
out
newly
technological
inventions
to
help
the
elder
people
feel
more
comfortable
and
content
with
their
ordinary
life
.

for
the
need
of
environmentally
friendly
energy
generated
,
the
possible
solutions
are
,
though
not
limited
to
,
alternate
sources
of
energy
and
increased
efficiency
of
fuel
to
energy
conversion
in
conventional
fossil
fuel
power
generators
.

the
government
estimates
that
by
the
year
2030
,
23
%
of
its
population
will
be
over
the
age
of
65
(
wijaya
,
2009
)
.

the
greater
use
of
cng
vehicles
for
public
transportation
will
result
in
a
quieter
-
urban
environment
,
which
will
be
a
plus
for
our
living
environment
.

massive
amount
of
radioactive
substances
spread
,
and
eventually
caused
approximately
270000
cancer
cases
and
93000
fatal
cancers
(
greenpeace
,
2006
)
.

in
addition
,
government
should
put
more
effort
-
and
invest
on
those
areas
that
-
productive
.

if
talking
about
the
accidents
,
coal
mining
is
more
dangerous
,
-
100
miners
are
dead
-
per
year
in
the
u.s
and
other
100
die
in
transporting
it
.

by
this
way
,
all
the
processes
are
often
set
up
from
the
beginning
,
though
sometimes
mistakes
were
found
and
need
adopting
.

indeed
,
the
fear
of
losing
privacy
is
a
distressing
concern
among
the
society
.

today
,
the
number
of
old
people
is
increasing
.

they
are
also
mechanically
stable
as
their
boiling
point
is
very
high
.

now
,
people
-
are
living
longer
and
longer
lives
must
be
carefully
planned
for
.

humans
in
general
,
like
to
stay
within
their
comfort
zone
and
is
often
unwilling
to
accept
new
ideas
or
changes
in
their
lifestyle
.

the
most
common
factor
which
contributes
to
the
failing
of
the
process
is
the
insufficient
fund
provided
to
complete
the
whole
process
and
by
means
,
the
process
includes
-
definition
of
problems
,
narrowing
of
research
,
finding
of
several
alternative
solutions
,
determination
of
the
most
possible
solution
and
lastly
the
making
of
-
decision
.

(
24
february
2008
)
.

in
the
singapore
society
where
it
is
relatively
result
orientated
,
people
tend
to
be
afraid
to
try
out
new
ideas
as
they
are
afraid
they
will
lose
out
to
the
intense
competition
they
face
from
the
others
.

next
,
when
the
basic
and
application
research
of
the
technology
has
established
,
the
development
of
the
product
will
begin
.

therefore
,
this
indicates
that
the
demand
is
low
as
cyclists
who
travel
alone
,
in
pairs
,
or
in
small
groups
and
those
people
who
do
not
cycle
do
not
require
and
have
the
need
for
-
bike
bug
.

although
nuclear
wastes
will
be
produced
,
these
are
solid
wastes
that
can
be
stored
away
safely
with
current
technology
.

furthermore
,
according
to
''
a
technology
roadmap
``
(
2002
)
,
-
the
vhtr
can
generate
electricity
with
high
efficiency
,
over
50
%
at
1000°c
,
whereas
,
other
reactors
can
normally
have
an
efficiency
of
33
%
-50
%
.

the
present
paradigm
of
care
for
the
elderly
is
a
partnership
between
the
government
,
community
and
family
.

as
technology
is
getting
better
and
better
,
the
way
people
fight
with
each
other
is
also
improved
from
time
to
time
.

another
point
is
that
,
in
a
country
with
a
growing
aging
population
,
the
elderly
make
up
a
substantial
part
of
the
population
,
hence
play
a
bigger
role
in
decision-making
on
the
country
's
many
issues
.

in
conclusion
,
both
very
high
temperature
and
lead
cooled
fast
reactors
have
good
performance
and
excellent
safety
system
,
but
vhtrs
is
on
a
higher
end
as
compared
to
lfrs
due
to
the
greater
system
performance
and
system
safety
it
provides
.

however
,
it
is
not
ethical
to
pass
on
their
defective
genes
to
their
offspring
in
order
to
fulfill
the
dream
of
having
own
family
.

furthermore
,
this
report
also
stated
that
rfid
tags
could
promote
the
frequent
access
for
the
patient
to
their
medical
information
and
increase
the
continuity
and
coordination
of
care
which
resulting
reduction
many
kind
of
medical
error
like
adverse
drugs
event
.

and
when
they
have
-
ideas
-
how
to
solve
this
problem
,
they
need
to
ensure
-
they
select
the
idea
that
is
achievable
with
the
current
technology
by
``
analysing
the
solutions
''
.

in
view
of
the
accelerating
of
ageing
population
,
singapore
's
government
has
been
revamping
the
related
policies
constantly
to
mitigate
the
problem
.

hopefully
,
successful
technologies
-
are
produced
by
both
means
.

nuclear
energy
uses
uranium
as
a
form
of
energy
,
which
is
a
scarce
resource
.

this
will
reduce
the
greenhouse
emissions
as
smaller
amounts
of
fuel
would
be
needed
to
-
generate
the
same
amount
of
energy
,
thus
meeting
our
need
.

finally
the
tanker
sank
and
spilled
the
oil
(

}

]
)
.

thirdly
,
there
should
be
an
increase
in
fund
on
the
healthcare
sector
.

despite
so
,
proponents
assured
that
with
proper
storage
and
appropriate
protection
measures
,
the
nuclear
waste
should
not
pose
any
health
risk
to
the
public
.

if
that
were
to
happen
,
it
would
impact
the
society
as
social
cost
would
increase
and
the
younger
generation
may
find
it
harder
to
start
a
family
.

however
,
in
terms
of
process
and
effort
,
the
research
to
develop
new
technology
is
different
from
the
serendipitous
discovery
.

hence
,
the
government
should
be
advised
to
continue
providing
for
the
aged
,
trying
to
overcome
the
obstacles
presented
and
thus
increase
the
provision
whenever
needed
.

although
at
that
time
they
only
focused
on
solar
power
plant
.

currently
,
the
materials
applied
in
vhtr
are
more
advanced
and
steady
compared
to
the
past
.

whenever
a
change
the
route
during
flight
,
it
require
some
amount
of
time
before
the
pre-allocated
waypoint
can
be
reset
.

some
of
the
most
well-known
strategies
for
dealing
with
the
aging
population
are
extending
retirement
age
,
lengthening
working
lives
and
encouraging
financial
planning
during
economically
active
year
.

psychology
is
useful
in
foreseeing
latent
errors
and
thus
it
is
easier
to
come
out
with
-
solution
that
will
reduce
the
probability
of
-
accident
.

however
,
research
studies
(
butler
,
2004
)
shows
that
vhtr
do
not
undergo
waste
recycling
for
which
the
waste
being
produced
will
go
directly
to
-
repository
and
this
lead
to
the
possibility
of
obtaining
of
plutonium
ingredients
to
make
nuclear
weapons
to
be
low
and
in
turn
,
-
increased
the
security
of
the
nation
.

therefore
in
terms
of
researching
,
i
will
be
focusing
on
public
policies
aspect
of
the
ageing
population
.

people
living
in
well-developed
countries
have
high
standard
of
living
due
to
their
affluence
brought
about
by
the
stable
economy
.

however
,
the
operators
had
broken
many
important
rules
of
safety
just
to
complete
the
test
quickly
:
they
had
diminished
the
flow
of
coolant
water
,
disabled
the
automatic
shutdown
mechanisms
,
released
the
control
rods
from
the
machine
over
the
acceptable
limit
.

this
is
because
that
once
a
nuclear
reactor
accident
happened
,
it
would
be
a
huge
disaster
to
both
the
creatures
and
the
environment
within
that
area
.

this
is
-
possible
through
communication
with
their
colleagues
,
which
can
help
them
to
stay
optimistic
.

after
that
,
the
atomic
bomb
came
up
,
which
leads
the
end
of
the
world
war
ii
.

whichever
way
an
invention
is
created
,
it
helps
satisfy
human
needs
and
solve
existing
problems
.

so
it
is
important
to
come
out
with
ideas
which
will
be
a
useful
and
economic
solution
to
the
problem
.

therefore
,
having
longer
life
span
does
help
to
ease
-
aging
process
.

however
,
the
vhtr
is
initially
designed
to
use
helium
as
its
coolant
which
is
not
the
most
suitable
for
an
instant
passive
heat
removal
system
.

from
-
analysis
,
the
vhtr
will
spend
fuel
in
a
symbiotic
fuel
cycle
that
can
achieve
significant
reductions
in
waste
quantity
and
radio
toxicity
because
of
its
ability
to
accommodate
a
wide
variety
-
mixture
of
fissile
and
fertile
materials
without
significantly
modification
of
the
core
design
(
u.s.
department
of
energy
nuclear
,
2002
)
.

however
,
due
to
the
plant
simplification
,
its
design
is
far
simpler
,
that
is
,
without
the
circulation
pumps
,
pressurizers
,
steam
generators
and
dryers
.

considering
the
above
three
concerns
:
safety
,
cost
and
performance
,
the
generation
iv
international
forum
,
formed
by
ten
countries
,
puts
forward
six
outstanding
protocols
into
research
and
development
.

according
to
the
accident
investigation
report
(
ministry
of
manpower
,
2005
)
,
it
was
found
that
the
main
cause
of
the
collapse
was
due
to
underdesign
of
the
retaining
wall
which
could
not
handle
the
stress
of
holding
up
the
tunnel
.

one
popular
example
is
penicillin
,
where
it
turned
out
to
be
the
first
antibiotic
because
of
its
property
of
killing
biological
materials
when
it
was
left
in
petri
dishes
containing
biological
organisms
.

however
,
the
withdrawal
of
governmental
support
in
the
health
care
for
the
aged
would
shift
the
responsibility
to
the
families
of
these
aged
and
burden
the
development
of
the
country
in
the
long
run
.

therefore
,
this
has
increased
the
significance
of
-
cpf
as
it
compels
people
to
save
in
advance
lest
they
are
unable
or
have
no
one
to
support
them
during
their
old
age
.

therefore
-
most
of
china
enterprisers
focus
on
short-run
product
and
expect
instant
profit
.

subsequently
,
the
inventor
of
the
very
software
can
only
get
a
little
profit
,
which
will
not
impel
him
or
her
to
continue
paying
much
attention
to
the
innovation
.

a
country
that
is
not
expanding
as
fast
as
the
population
grows
will
bring
forward
insufficient
housing
for
its
people
.

in
consideration
of
these
factors
,
designers
have
conceived
the
3-d
printer
,
which
is
capable
of
speeding
up
designing
process
.

nevertheless
,
the
aging
process
is
commonly
viewed
as
an
unavoidable
,
undesirable
,
problem-ridden
phrase
of
life
that
we
are
required
to
go
through
it
.

people
are
afraid
of
gm
plants
may
break
the
balances
in
the
nature
.

because
of
the
staff
's
breach
of
duty
,
the
operators
detected
the
reactors
'
problem
very
late
and
-
even
took
erroneous
actions
.

besides
,
lots
public
spending
will
be
required
for
modifications
works
in
neighbourhood
estates
-
such
as
-
building
-
more
railings
and
slopes
with
anti-slipped
layer
(
tong
,
2007
)
.

importantly
as
it
is
,
very
few
old
people
managed
to
get
back
to
school
and
receive
education
again
.

besides
,
public
policies
that
encourage
and
facilitate
education
,
basic
research
,
and
the
application
of
promising
technologies
can
enhance
the
well-being
of
current
and
future
generations
of
older
people
(
robert
b.
friedland
and
laura
summer,2005
)
.in
other
words
,
elites
are
able
to
invent
more
advanced
technology
in
term
of
accelerate
nation
development
.

however
,
although
the
spending
on
the
aged
is
high
,
it
should
not
be
limited
.

meanwhile
,
helium
is
radioactive
when
it
is
radiated
,
unlike
the
other
coolants
.

therefore
,
the
current
development
,
research
and
policies
implemented
are
meant
to
ease
the
aging
process
-
and
they
are
highly
effective
.

today
,
one
of
the
main
concerns
about
human
need
is
the
innovation
of
a
more
environmental-friendly
vehicle
.

in
conclusion
,
surveillance
technology
should
be
banned
for
certain
degree
to
ensure
that
privacy
is
protected
and
the
security
issue
is
solved
also
.

for
elderlies
with
both
presbyopia
and
myopia
or
both
presbyopia
and
hyperopia
,
recent
improvements
in
lens
optics
has
created
bifocals
lens
(
convex
and
concave
lens
combined
into
a
single
lens
)
to
allow
the
elderly
to
have
both
their
presbyopia
and
myopia
or
both
their
presbyopia
and
hyperopia
to
be
corrected
.

therefore
,
the
adult
children
of
the
aged
seem
like
the
most
plausible
individuals
to
depend
on
by
providing
for
their
parents
.

several
problems
which
relate
to
the
issue
include
health
,
financial
and
welfare
of
the
elderly
has
come
under
the
concern
of
the
government
.

in
this
example
,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
original
design
work
,
but
the
design
still
can
not
be
carried
out
due
to
political
inconsistent
between
the
city
government
and
higher
level
authorities
.

however
,
they
should
take
in
consideration
-
that
there
are
elderly
from
the
past
generations
without
good
education
who
have
not
been
able
to
save
in
their
younger
days
.

for
example
,
the
carbon-fibre
reinforced
carbon
can
bear
the
highest
temperature
which
the
vhtr
could
generate
.

there
are
cars
designed
for
easy
entry
for
the
wheelchair-bound
or
those
with
difficulty
walking
,
like
-
toyota
motor
corp.
's
welcab
series
.

conversely
,
if
the
country
is
not
knowledge
based
,
it
can
hardly
make
any
economic
progress
-
due
to
the
lack
of
understanding
of
technology
-
development
thus
leading
to
shortages
in
the
government
's
annual
budget
for
the
aged
.

moreover
,
lfr
has
a
comparative
safety
advantage
compared
to
the
other
nuclear
reactors
designs
.

such
policies
include
social
policy
like
increasing
the
retirement
age
,
allowing
more
work
age
immigrants
into
the
country
and
introducing
retirement
scheme
to
ease
basic
needs
after
retirement
.

adding
on
to
the
misery
,
the
cost
associated
with
healthcare
is
also
growing
with
the
combined
effect
of
-
rising
standard
of
living
and
-
high
cost
of
advanced
medical
development
.

the
elderly
can
be
stronger
and
less
of
them
will
be
suffering
from
physical
illnesses
,
such
as
stroke
,
diabetes
,
cancer
and
high
blood
pressure
.

in
addition
,
msr
uses
liquid
fuel
as
compared
to
the
other
reactors
that
use
solid
fuel
.

as
in
terms
of
all
the
policies
and
development
mentioned
above
,
especially
about
the
workfare
scheme
,
the
government
should
increase
the
net
payout
amount
(
cash
)
and
reduce
the
percentage
contributing
to
the
cpf
.

a
600
mwth
vhtr
dedicated
to
hydrogen
production
can
yield
over
2
million
normal
cubic
meters
per
day
.

besides
,
medisave
can
be
easily
drained
especially
on
chronic
illnesses
,
which
can
tote
up
to
a
huge
amount
.

some
governments
even
do
it
``
too
''
well
that
a
large
amount
of
money
,
which
should
be
spent
on
other
social
issues
,
is
wasted
.

the
consequences
of
-
population
aging
are
presenting
both
opportunities
and
challenges
for
all
nations
.

therefore
,
with
the
advancing
technologies
,
it
does
not
mean
that
every
product
that
was
invented
would
help
the
elderly
to
ease
into
the
aging
process
.

first
,
the
current
government
policies
are
not
easing
the
ageing
process
because
they
are
limited
to
a
specified
group
of
the
aged
population
.

nevertheless
,
singapore
is
planning
to
increase
their
spending
to
6.8
billion
euros
by
2010
and
target
to
spend
3
%
of
their
gdp
(
gafoor
,
2008
)
.

also
,
the
government
can
direct
more
technological
resources
to
school
so
as
to
better
equip
the
younger
generation
in
the
technological-edged
world
,
improving
their
economical
worth
.

tiles
or
pavements
with
better
friction
have
been
placed
in
toilets
to
prevent
-
elderly
from
slipping
.

applicants
for
insurance
will
be
under
increased
pressure
to
undergo
genetic
tests
and
those
prone
to
diseases
are
less
likely
to
be
eligible
to
buy
insurance
.

besides
,
the
aged
may
also
choose
to
carry
a
portable
digital
magnifier
which
takes
-
picture
behind
the
device
,
magnifies
it
to
-
desired
clearness
and
show
it
on
the
screen
such
as
pocketviewer
.

different
countries
also
promulgated
different
regulations
to
limit
the
use
of
the
camera
phone
.

furthermore
,
parents
would
resort
in
using
webcams
and
gps
systems
to
check
on
their
children
'
activities
(
ball
,
k.
&
et
al
.

the
aged
are
advised
to
solve
their
problems
as
possible
as
they
can
and
put
the
public
support
as
their
second
choice
.

it
is
more
ideal
if
a
win-win
situation
could
be
established
,
as
this
will
also
give
a
good
reflection
on
the
country
's
overall
progress
,
both
internally
and
externally
.

obviously
,
efforts
that
the
government
put
in
developing
the
economics
of
our
country
have
resulted
-
a
successfully
growth
and
inevitably
,
this
has
contributed
in
easing
and
solving
the
problems
of
aging
population
.
